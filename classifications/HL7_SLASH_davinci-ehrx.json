It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 directly, nor does it focus on CDA document exchange. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and its definition of profiles and operations that could be used in conjunction with other HL7 standards suggests a moderate level of cross-paradigm awareness.",
