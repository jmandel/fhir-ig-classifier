It leverages FHIR's RESTful architecture and resource model extensively. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it doesn't directly integrate with them, focusing solely on a FHIR-based approach. The IG does not use CDA, v2, or v3, but it does mention the International Patient Summary (IPS) IG, which is a cross-paradigm specification.",
