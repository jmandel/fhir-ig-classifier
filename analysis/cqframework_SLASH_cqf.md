# cqf: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

-   **Primary interoperability challenges this IG addresses:** This IG doesn't explicitly state interoperability challenges. However, based on the provided content, it seems to be related to a project or organization named "cqf" (perhaps Clinical Quality Framework), likely focusing on clinical quality measures, decision support, or related areas within the healthcare domain. The presence of a GitHub repository for issues suggests a focus on collaborative development and issue tracking.
-   **Key clinical/business problems it solves:**  The provided content doesn't directly address specific clinical or business problems. However, the "cqf" context and the focus on issue tracking suggest it might be related to improving the development, implementation, or maintenance of clinical quality measures or decision support systems.
-   **Intended scope and boundaries:** The scope appears to be limited to providing a mechanism for feedback and issue tracking related to the "cqf" project. The boundaries are defined by the GitHub repository's issue tracker.

## Technical Foundation

-   **Core profiles and extensions:** Not applicable based on the provided content.
-   **Notable operations and interactions:** The primary interaction is submitting and viewing issues on the GitHub repository.
-   **Key terminology and value sets:** Not applicable based on the provided content.
-   **Significant patterns and constraints:** The only constraint is that feedback and issues must be submitted through the designated GitHub repository.

## Technical Essence

This IG defines a feedback mechanism for the "cqf" project, leveraging GitHub's issue tracking system. It establishes two entry points: "New Issue" for creating new issues and "Issues" for viewing existing ones, both pointing to specific URLs within the `cqframework/cqf` repository. This simple structure facilitates community engagement and centralized issue management for the project.

## Implementation Approach

-   **Critical workflows and interactions:** The primary workflow is users submitting issues via the "New Issue" link and interacting with existing issues via the "Issues" link.
-   **Important requirements and guardrails:** Users must have a GitHub account to interact with the issue tracker. Issues should be relevant to the "cqf" project.
-   **Notable design choices and patterns:** The use of GitHub's issue tracker is a common and effective pattern for managing feedback and issues in open-source projects.

## Ecosystem Context

-   **Target systems and users:** The target users are likely developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders involved in the "cqf" project. The target system is the GitHub platform.
-   **Relationship to other standards/IGs:** The relationship to other standards or IGs is not explicitly defined in the provided content. However, the "cqf" context suggests a potential connection to FHIR-based clinical quality measures or decision support standards.
-   **Relevant jurisdictions or programs:** Not specified in the provided content.
-   **Primary use cases and scenarios:** The primary use case is to provide a platform for reporting bugs, suggesting features, and discussing issues related to the "cqf" project.

**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the limited information provided in the `features.yml` file and the `license.md` file. A more comprehensive analysis would require access to the full FHIR IG. The inclusion of the Apache License 2.0, along with a health-related disclaimer, suggests that the "cqf" project may involve healthcare-related software or data, further reinforcing the potential connection to clinical quality measures or decision support.
