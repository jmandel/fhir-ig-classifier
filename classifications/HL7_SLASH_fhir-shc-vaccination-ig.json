  "rationale": "The SMART Health Cards Vaccination and Testing Implementation Guide defines a set of FHIR profiles and usage guidelines for representing vaccination records and laboratory test results related to infectious diseases within a SMART Health Card. The core functionality of this IG is to define the structure and content of FHIR resources that represent this clinical data, focusing on data minimization to protect patient privacy and ensure the SMART Health Card fits within size constraints.\n\nSpecifically, this IG defines:\n\n1.  **Profiles for Patient resources:** `shc-patient-general-dm`, `shc-patient-general-ad`, `shc-patient-us-dm`, and `shc-patient-us-ad`. These profiles constrain the allowable data elements for representing patient demographics, with a focus on minimizing the inclusion of sensitive information.\n2.  **Profiles for Immunization resources:** `shc-vaccination-dm` and `shc-vaccination-ad`. These profiles define how to represent a single vaccination event, including the vaccine administered, date, and other relevant details. They specify required and optional elements, and provide guidance on using standard code systems like CVX, ICD-11 MMS, and SNOMED CT to identify vaccines.\n3.  **Profiles for Observation resources:** `shc-covid19-laboratory-result-observation-dm`, `shc-covid19-laboratory-result-observation-ad`, `shc-infectious-disease-laboratory-result-observation-dm`, and `shc-infectious-disease-laboratory-result-observation-ad`. These profiles define how to represent laboratory test results, including the test performed, the result, and the date of the test. They provide guidance on using standard code systems like LOINC and SNOMED CT.\n4.  **Profiles for Bundle resources:** `shc-vaccination-bundle-dm`, `shc-vaccination-bundle-ad`, `shc-covid19-laboratory-bundle-dm`, `shc-covid19-laboratory-bundle-ad`, `shc-infectious-disease-laboratory-bundle-dm`, and `shc-infectious-disease-laboratory-bundle-ad`. These profiles define the structure of the FHIR Bundle that contains the Patient, Immunization, and/or Observation resources within a SMART Health Card. They specify the required resource types and provide guidance on how to organize the resources within the Bundle.\n\nIn addition to defining these profiles, the IG provides extensive guidance on data minimization, terminology usage, and conformance requirements for issuers and verifiers of SMART Health Cards. It also includes examples of how to represent various clinical scenarios using the defined profiles.",
