    "summary": "The Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) IG primarily focuses on enabling the secure and efficient exchange of patient clinical and administrative data between payers, providers, and patients. It leverages FHIR R4, US Core, and HRex profiles, extending them with PDex-specific profiles to handle payer-specific use cases like prior authorization and member-match. While it touches upon clinical data and medications through the use of US Core profiles, its core purpose revolves around administrative data exchange, particularly claims and encounter data (without financial details), to facilitate compliance with CMS regulations, improve care coordination, and empower patient data access. Identity and security are paramount, with OAuth 2.0 and SMART on FHIR mandated for authorization and app integration. Provenance resources are also crucial for tracking data origin and handling. The IG has limited focus on care planning, clinical knowledge, diagnostics, public health, quality reporting, and research.",
