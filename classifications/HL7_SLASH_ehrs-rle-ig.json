It heavily relies on FHIR's RESTful architecture and resource definitions. While it acknowledges and builds upon concepts from the EHR-S FM, which has roots in HL7 v3, the IG's implementation is entirely within the FHIR paradigm. There's no mention or use of CDA or v2 messaging.",

It leverages FHIR's `AuditEvent` and `Provenance` resources to capture comprehensive metadata related to 29 Record Lifecycle Events (RLEs), ensuring data integrity, accountability, and compliance with health information management standards. While it touches upon clinical data through its association with record entries, its core purpose revolves around the administrative and workflow aspects of record management, with a strong emphasis on identity and security through audit trails.",

Payer systems may have a minimal role in accessing audit information for claims processing. Public health systems might utilize aggregated audit data for population health analysis. Research platforms could leverage the standardized audit data for research purposes, with appropriate de-identification. Other systems have limited or no involvement.",
