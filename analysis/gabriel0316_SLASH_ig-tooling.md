# ig-tooling: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to define the structure, format, and standards for the Austrian Patient Summary (Austrian PS) by combining the specifications of the International Patient Summary (IPS) and the HL7® Austria FHIR® Core Implementation Guide. It provides a standardized way to represent patient data in Austria, using FHIR. The context is the need for a consistent and interoperable way to share patient information within Austria, aligned with international standards. It is for healthcare providers, software developers, and potentially patients who need to share or access health data.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG builds upon existing HL7® Austria FHIR® Core profiles and ensures IPS conformity by using the `imposeProfile` extension. This approach aims to provide a more standardized and interoperable way to handle patient data in Austria and align it with international IPS standards. It introduces specific profiles for various FHIR resources, extending the Austrian Core profiles and ensuring IPS compliance. Prior approaches are not explicitly detailed in the provided files, but the IG's description notes it addresses the "absence of a corresponding profile in the HL7® Austria FHIR® Core implementation guide," suggesting it fills a gap.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **Profiles:** It defines specific profiles for FHIR resources (e.g., Bundle, Composition, Patient, AllergyIntolerance, Condition, etc.) that inherit from base FHIR resources and/or HL7® Austria FHIR® Core profiles and enforce IPS constraints via the `imposeProfile` extension.
    *   **Slicing:** It uses slicing to define specific structures for entries in Bundles and sections in Compositions.
    *   **Code Systems:** It uses LOINC, SNOMED CT, and other code systems for standardized terminology.
    *   **Examples:** It includes example bundles demonstrating how to use the defined profiles.
    *   **Structure:** It defines required and optional sections within the Composition resource.
    *   **Use of References:** It emphasizes references between resources using full URLs.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is directly related to the International Patient Summary (IPS) standard, which is an international standard for exchanging essential patient information. It also depends on the HL7® Austria FHIR® Core Implementation Guide, indicating alignment with Austrian national standards. It uses FHIR as the base standard, linking it to broader interoperability efforts in healthcare. It also references the EU standard term repository using the alias `$asp`.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    *   **Primary users:** Software developers implementing systems for healthcare data exchange in Austria.
    *   **Secondary users:** Healthcare providers in Austria who need to access or share patient information.
    *   **Beneficiaries:** Patients in Austria, who will benefit from improved data exchange and continuity of care. The contest also indicates a potential benefit for students and researchers.
