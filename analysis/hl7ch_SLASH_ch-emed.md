# ch-emed: Analysis

1. **Objectives and Context:** The "ch-emed" Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the exchange of medication-related information in Switzerland. It defines how to represent medication prescriptions, dispenses, treatment plans, pharmaceutical advice, and medication lists using the FHIR standard. This enables interoperability between different healthcare systems, such as those used by hospitals, pharmacies, and general practitioners, improving medication safety and efficiency.

2. **Improvements over Previous Approaches:** The IG does not explicitly state how it improves upon previous approaches. However, by adopting FHIR, it leverages a modern, widely recognized standard for healthcare data exchange, promoting interoperability and data consistency.

3. **Key Features and Technical Approaches:** 
    - **FHIR Profiles:** The IG defines FHIR profiles for various medication-related resources, such as MedicationStatement, MedicationDispense, and MedicationRequest. These profiles constrain and extend the base FHIR resources to meet Swiss-specific requirements.
    - **Extensions:** The IG introduces extensions to capture additional data elements relevant to the Swiss context, including references to external documents, identifiers for medication entries, and last considered documents.
    - **ValueSets:** The IG utilizes value sets from established code systems like LOINC, SNOMED CT, and Swiss-specific extensions to ensure consistent coding of medication information.
    - **Invariants:** The IG defines invariants (rules) to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring data quality and validity.
    - **Examples:** The IG provides numerous examples of FHIR resources in various scenarios, demonstrating the practical application of the profiles and extensions.

4. **Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations:** The IG aligns with Swiss healthcare regulations, particularly the Swiss EPR (Electronic Patient Record) regulation, by incorporating specific confidentiality codes and data elements required by the legislation. It also references international standards like LOINC and SNOMED CT for coding, ensuring broader interoperability.

5. **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**
    - **Healthcare Professionals:** Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare providers benefit from streamlined medication information exchange, reducing errors and improving patient care.
    - **Healthcare Organizations:** Hospitals, pharmacies, and general practices can exchange medication data seamlessly, enhancing efficiency and patient safety.
    - **Patients:** Ultimately, patients benefit from improved medication safety, better coordinated care, and potentially reduced adverse drug events.
