It heavily relies on FHIR resources, profiles, and operations to define how CQL logic is represented, packaged, and evaluated within the FHIR ecosystem. It does not use CDA, v2, or v3 directly, but acknowledges the HL7 Cross-Paradigm Specification for Representing Negatives, indicating a minimal level of cross-paradigm awareness.",
