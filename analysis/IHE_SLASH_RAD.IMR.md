# RAD.IMR: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG, the Interactive Multimedia Report (IMR) Profile, aims to standardize how diagnostic reports with interactive multimedia content, like images and measurements, are encoded, communicated, and presented. It focuses on the context of radiology reporting, where reports need to include references to images and related data. The primary audience is implementers of systems that handle diagnostic reports, particularly in radiology.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG introduces a structured way to embed multimedia content within diagnostic reports, addressing the limitations of simple text-based reports or non-standard ways of linking to multimedia. It uses FHIR resources like `DiagnosticReport`, `ServiceRequest`, `ImagingStudy`, and `ImagingSelection` to achieve this, allowing for more interactive and contextually relevant access to multimedia content. The use of FHIR allows for better interoperability compared to previous approaches.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   Use of FHIR `DiagnosticReport` as the central resource for multimedia reports.
    *   Use of `ImagingSelection` to specify references to images and other multimedia content.
    *   A requirement for a rendered HTML version of the report to be included.
    *   Use of `<span>` elements with custom attributes to embed image references in narrative text.
    *   Profiles for `Endpoint`, `Observation`, and `ServiceRequest` to support the diagnostic report.
    *   Defines a "Store Multimedia Report" transaction for sending the report.
    *   Defines a "Find Multimedia Report" transaction for querying reports.
    *   Defines a "Retrieve Rendered Multimedia Report" transaction to retrieve pre-rendered reports.
    *   Defines a "Display Multimedia Report" which is a logical transaction focusing on display behavior.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds on HL7 FHIR standards, which are increasingly used in healthcare for interoperability. It also references DICOM standards for imaging and WADO-RS for image retrieval. The IG includes security considerations such as the use of ATNA for auditing. The IG explicitly states it is not yet recommended for production and is intended for experimental implementation and feedback.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are healthcare professionals, particularly radiologists and clinicians, who need access to diagnostic reports with embedded multimedia content. Beneficiaries include these professionals, who will have more interactive and contextually rich reports, and indirectly patients, who will benefit from improved diagnostic communication and care coordination. Patients are not direct users of the IG, but their care is improved through the enhanced reporting capabilities.
