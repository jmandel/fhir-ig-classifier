  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-saner\" focuses on enabling the transmission of situational awareness information, particularly related to novel epidemics like COVID-19. It defines a system architecture comprised of components for reporting, presentation, adaptation, FHIR server interaction, and external storage. \n\n**Functional Domain:** The IG's primary focus is on Public Health, as it aims to support public health surveillance and response during epidemics. It also touches on Clinical Care by defining measures related to hospital capacity and patient impact. Additionally, it has elements related to Infrastructure & Foundational aspects, such as defining actors, transactions, and security considerations.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The IG is based on FHIR R4, as indicated by the `fhirVersion: 4.0.1` in the `sushi-config.yaml` file. It defines FHIR resources, profiles, extensions, and operations based on FHIR R4.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The IG focuses on both Data Exchange and Data Modeling. It defines transactions for exchanging data between different actors (e.g., Query Measure, Produce Measure) and specifies profiles and extensions for resources like Measure and MeasureReport. It also includes elements of Workflow Support by defining actors and their interactions. Security & Privacy considerations are also addressed.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** While the IG specifies `jurisdiction: \"World\"`, indicating a Universal Realm intent, the examples and some specific vocabulary used suggest a focus on the United States. However, it also references other national models, suggesting broader applicability.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The IG is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including Public Health Organizations (for collecting and analyzing data), Healthcare Provider Organizations (for reporting data), Technical Implementers (for developing systems that implement the IG), and Standards Organizations (for defining and maintaining the standard).",
