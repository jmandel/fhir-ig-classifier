  "rationale": "The DaVinci Attribution (ATR) Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining the standards for exchanging Member Attribution Lists between payers and providers using HL7 FHIR. The core functionality revolves around enabling providers to access and reconcile lists of patients attributed to them under value-based care arrangements. \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines a set of FHIR profiles, operations, and usage guidelines to facilitate this exchange. It leverages the FHIR R4 standard and builds upon existing specifications like US Core, Bulk Data, and SMART on FHIR Backend Services Authorization. \n\nThe IG introduces a specialized \"davinci-data-export\" operation, profiled from the Bulk Data Export operation, to retrieve Member Attribution Lists. It also defines \"member-add\" and \"member-remove\" operations to allow providers to reconcile these lists by adding or removing members. A \"confirm-attribution-list\" operation signals the completion of reconciliation, and an \"attribution-status\" operation allows querying the attribution status of a specific member.\n\nFurthermore, the IG specifies requirements for representing contracts, plans, coverage, attribution periods, and attributed providers within the FHIR resources. It outlines how to handle identifiers, security, and privacy considerations. The IG also provides guidance on using FHIR Subscriptions for notifications of changes to Member Attribution Lists.\n\nIn essence, the DaVinci ATR IG creates a framework for standardized, interoperable exchange of Member Attribution Lists, primarily focusing on data modeling (defining FHIR profiles for relevant resources) and data exchange (defining operations for retrieving and modifying these lists). It's geared towards the US healthcare market, targeting stakeholders like EHR vendors, provider organizations, and payers involved in value-based care.",
