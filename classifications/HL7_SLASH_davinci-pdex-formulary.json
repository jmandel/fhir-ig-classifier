It does not use CDA or v2, and while it acknowledges v3 through the use of RxNorm (which originated in v3), it doesn't deeply integrate with v3 models. It demonstrates cross-paradigm support by leveraging other FHIR-based IGs like US Core and HRex.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on standardizing the exchange of drug formulary information, primarily between health insurers and patients. It leverages FHIR resources like InsurancePlan, Basic, and MedicationKnowledge to represent formulary data, including drug tiers, cost-sharing, and coverage limitations. The primary goal is to improve transparency in prescription drug costs and coverage, enabling informed decision-making for patients and providers. While it touches upon administrative aspects related to insurance plans and utilizes clinical data like drug codes, its core purpose revolves around insurance and financial aspects of medication coverage.",

Clinical care teams also have a significant role, using this information to guide prescribing decisions. Public health agencies and research organizations have a defined but limited role, potentially using this data for population health analysis and research. Government agencies have a minimal role, primarily related to oversight and regulation of data exchange standards.
