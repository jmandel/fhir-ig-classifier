  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-pacio-functional-status\" defines a set of profiles and extensions for representing and exchanging functional status assessments, primarily focusing on mobility, self-care, and domestic life observations. The IG is built upon FHIR R4 and leverages US Core profiles. It defines specific profiles like `FunctionalStatusCollection`, `FunctionalStatus`, `NarrativeHistoryOfFunctionalStatus`, and `UseOfDevice`. These profiles are designed to capture data collected through structured assessment instruments used in post-acute care (PAC) settings, although the IG indicates an intent to expand beyond PAC in the future. The IG provides guidance on using standardized coding systems like LOINC and SNOMED for assessment data elements. It also includes examples of how to construct profile instances for data exchange, referencing specific PAC assessment instruments like the MDS and OASIS. The IG emphasizes the importance of interoperability for care coordination during transitions between healthcare settings and includes considerations for security and data sharing using SMART-on-FHIR and OAuth2.0. The IG's content suggests a strong focus on data modeling, defining the structure and content of functional status data, with a secondary focus on data exchange mechanisms.",
