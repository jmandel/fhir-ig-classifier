  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"ebm\" focuses on defining a set of FHIR profiles and extensions to represent scientific knowledge, particularly within the context of evidence-based medicine. The core functionality of this IG is to create new structural definitions (profiles) for existing FHIR resources, tailoring them for specific use cases in evidence representation, synthesis, and reporting. \n\nThe IG defines profiles for Resources like Evidence, EvidenceVariable, Group, Citation, ArtifactAssessment, and Composition. These profiles constrain and extend the base FHIR resources to capture concepts relevant to evidence-based medicine, such as study design elements, statistical findings, certainty assessments, and structured reporting formats. For example, the Evidence profiles define how to represent variables, statistics, and certainty, while the Group profiles define how to represent study populations and eligibility criteria. The Citation profiles define how to represent bibliographic information for various types of knowledge artifacts. The ArtifactAssessment profiles define how to represent comments, classifications, and ratings of other resources. The Composition profiles define how to structure reports that combine these elements.\n\nAdditionally, the IG defines extensions to support features from FHIR R6 within the R5 base, such as the `characteristicExpression` extension for Group, which allows more flexible definition of group membership criteria. It also defines extensions for metadata about the resources, such as `url`, `version`, `title`, `status`, `experimental`, `date`, `publisher`, `contact`, `useContext`, `purpose`, `copyright`, `copyrightLabel`, `author`, and `relatedArtifact`. The IG also defines value sets for specific concepts, such as evidence variable role subtypes and evidence report section codes. The IG does not focus on defining specific workflows or interactions between systems, but rather on the structure and content of the information being exchanged. It is primarily aimed at technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and health IT development teams, who need to implement these profiles in their systems. It also targets standards organizations and government agencies involved in defining and promoting interoperability standards. The IG is intended for international use, as indicated by the jurisdiction \"World\" in the configuration file.",
