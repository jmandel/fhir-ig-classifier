    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (ch-epr-term) is fundamentally based on FHIR R4 for defining Swiss-specific terminology. It does not utilize CDA, v2, or v3. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and reference to other standards like SNOMED CT and EDQM, as well as its dependency on `hl7.terminology`, suggests a deliberate effort to support broader HL7 standards where applicable.",

It heavily emphasizes the use of Code Systems, Value Sets, and Concept Maps to ensure consistent and interoperable use of clinical terms, especially related to vaccinations and allergies. While it touches upon aspects of clinical data and medications through its terminology definitions, its core purpose is to provide a foundational terminology resource rather than to define workflows, processes, or detailed clinical data exchange mechanisms.",

Clinical Decision Support systems will benefit from standardized terminology for accurate alerts and guidance.
