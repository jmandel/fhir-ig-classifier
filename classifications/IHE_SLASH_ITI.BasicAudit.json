  "rationale": "The ITI Basic Audit Log Patterns (BALP) Implementation Guide defines a set of reusable AuditEvent profiles primarily focused on enhancing the security and privacy aspects of healthcare data exchange. The core functionality of this IG revolves around defining the structure and content of AuditEvent resources for various scenarios, including FHIR RESTful operations, security token usage (SAML and OAuth), consent-based authorization decisions, and privacy disclosures. \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines profiles for capturing audit information related to Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Query operations within the FHIR framework. It also provides detailed guidance on how to incorporate security token information into AuditEvents, offering patterns for both minimal and comprehensive recording of SAML and OAuth token attributes. Furthermore, it addresses the recording of authorization decisions based on patient consent and the logging of privacy-related data disclosures. \n\nThe IG emphasizes the importance of associating audit events with patient subjects when applicable, enabling privacy accounting and audit log analysis. It also introduces the concept of minimal vs. comprehensive AuditEvent patterns, balancing the need for detailed audit information with privacy and security considerations. The IG does not define new transactions but rather provides content profiles to be used in conjunction with existing IHE transactions, such as those defined in the ATNA profile. The primary artifacts created by this IG are the StructureDefinition profiles for AuditEvent resources, along with supporting ValueSets and CodeSystems.",
