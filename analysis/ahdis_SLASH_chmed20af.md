# chmed20af: Analysis

1. **Objectives and Context:** The CHMED20AF Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the exchange of medication-related information in Switzerland using the FHIR standard. It focuses on two key exchange formats:
    - **Medication Card Document (CARD):** Provides a comprehensive overview of a patient's current medications, intended for patient and clinician use.
    - **Medication Prescription Document (PRE):**  Defines the structure of a prescription document generated by healthcare professionals, enabling electronic transmission of prescriptions.

2. **Improvements over Previous Approaches:** The IG doesn't explicitly state how it improves upon prior methods. However, by adopting FHIR R4, it leverages a more mature and widely adopted version of the standard compared to the previous STU3 version used in v0.1.0. This implies enhanced interoperability, data consistency, and potential integration with other FHIR-based systems.

3. **Key Features and Technical Approaches:** 
    - **FHIR R4:** Utilizes FHIR Release 4 for representing medication data.
    - **Bundle Resource:** Employs Bundle to encapsulate the entire document, including the Composition resource and related entries.
    - **Composition Resource:** Structures the document, defining sections for medication lists, health concerns, annotations, and the original representation.
    - **MedicationStatement (CARD):** Records a patient's medication usage.
    - **MedicationRequest (PRE):** Represents a prescription order.
    - **Observation:** Captures patient medical data like body weight, height, etc.
    - **Condition:** Records patient risks, such as allergies or diabetes.
    - **Binary Resource:** Embeds the original PDF representation of the document.
    - **Mappings to eMediplan:** Provides explicit mappings to the eMediplan specification, ensuring alignment with Swiss healthcare data exchange standards.

4. **Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations:** The IG references various established healthcare standards:
    - **SNOMED CT:** Used for coding medical concepts like substances, units of presentation, and medical conditions.
    - **LOINC:**  Employed for coding observations and document types.
    - **ATC:** Utilized for coding medications according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.
    - **UCUM:**  Applied for units of measurement.
    - **HL7 v2:** Referenced for patient identifier types.
    - **Swiss EPR Standards:** Aligns with Swiss Electronic Patient Record standards through the use of extensions and specific profiles.

5. **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:** 
    - **Healthcare Professionals:**  Benefit from standardized prescription exchange and access to comprehensive medication information.
    - **Patients:**  Gain access to their medication information in a structured and understandable format.
    - **Pharmacists:**  Receive prescriptions electronically, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
    - **Software Developers:**  Utilize the IG to develop interoperable systems for managing and exchanging medication data in the Swiss healthcare context.
