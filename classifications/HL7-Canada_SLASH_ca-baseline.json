    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on FHIR, establishing a baseline for Canadian-specific FHIR profiles. It does not utilize HL7 v2, v3, or CDA directly, as its core purpose is to define a common set of FHIR resources and profiles. While it doesn't directly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, it acknowledges the broader HL7 ecosystem by building upon US Core and referencing existing Canadian IGs that may interact with other HL7 standards.",

It also mentions alignment with pan-Canadian standards and relevance to all Canadian provinces and territories, as well as Canada Health Infoway.",

While it touches upon other domains, its main purpose is to provide a common starting point for more specific IGs, rather than directly addressing complex workflows, clinical knowledge, or specialized areas like research or public health.",
