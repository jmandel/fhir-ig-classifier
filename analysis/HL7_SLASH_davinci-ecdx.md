## Core Purpose & Scope

The Da Vinci Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) Implementation Guide (IG) addresses the interoperability challenges related to the exchange of clinical data between providers and payers (or between providers) to support value-based care. It primarily solves the problem of inefficient and often manual data exchange processes that hinder claims management, prior authorization, care coordination, risk adjustment, and quality reporting. The IG's scope is focused on defining FHIR-based interactions for requesting and sending clinical information, including attachments for claims and prior authorizations. It supports direct queries, task-based asynchronous workflows, and solicited/unsolicited attachment exchanges. The IG is bounded by its reliance on FHIR R4 and its relationship with other Da Vinci IGs, particularly HRex, US Core, PAS, CRD, and DTR.

## Technical Foundation

The technical foundation of CDex rests on FHIR R4, with core profiles and extensions defined to constrain and extend base FHIR resources. Key profiles include:

-   **CDex Task Data Request Profile:** Defines the structure for requesting data using various methods (search syntax, code, free text, Questionnaire).
-   **CDex Task Attachment Request Profile:** Specializes the Task profile for requesting attachments for claims or prior authorization.
-   **CDex Signature Bundle Profile:** Defines how to use digital signatures with FHIR Bundles.
-   **CDex SDC QuestionnaireResponse Profile:** Profiles QuestionnaireResponse for use with signatures and attachments.
-   **CDex Parameters Submit Attachment Profile:** Defines the structure for the `Parameters` resource used in the `$submit-attachment` operation.

Notable operations include:

-   **`$submit-attachment`:** A custom operation for pushing attachments to a payer.

Key terminology and value sets include:

-   **CDex Purpose of Use Value Set:** Defines codes for expressing the purpose of data requests.
-   **CDex Work Queue Value Set:** Provides codes for tagging tasks with work queue hints.
-   **CDex LOINC Attachment Codes Value Set:** Defines codes for requesting attachments using LOINC.
-   **CDex PWK01 Attachment Report Type Code Value Set:** Defines codes for requesting attachments using X12 PWK01 codes.

Significant patterns and constraints include the use of Task for asynchronous workflows, the use of contained resources within Task, and the specification of digital signature requirements using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and X.509 certificates.

## Technical Essence

CDex leverages FHIR R4 to enable clinical data exchange through direct queries, task-based workflows, and attachment submissions. Data Consumers, typically payers, can perform direct FHIR RESTful searches on Data Source systems, typically EHRs, for specific patient data using US Core profiles. For more complex or asynchronous requests, CDex defines a Task-based approach where a Data Consumer creates a Task resource conforming to the CDex Task Data Request Profile, specifying the requested data via FHIR search syntax, codes, free text, or a reference to a Questionnaire. The Task includes optional inputs for purpose of use and work queue hints. The Data Source fulfills the Task, updating its status and referencing the output data in `Task.output`, which can be a Bundle, DocumentReference, QuestionnaireResponse, or other FHIR resources. For attachments, CDex defines a specialized `$submit-attachment` operation using a profiled `Parameters` resource to push attachments to a payer-specified endpoint, supporting both solicited and unsolicited workflows. Digital signatures, when required, are applied to Bundles or QuestionnaireResponses using the CDex Signature profiles, employing JWS with detached payloads and X.509 certificates for verification. The IG mandates support for polling to retrieve completed Tasks and optionally supports subscriptions for notifications.

## Implementation Approach

Implementers are expected to support direct FHIR RESTful queries and the Task-based approach, with optional support for free text and Questionnaire inputs. The IG emphasizes the use of polling for Task status updates, with an option for subscriptions. Key workflows include the creation and updating of Task resources, the fetching of referenced data, and the submission of attachments using the `$submit-attachment` operation. Implementers must adhere to the defined profiles and extensions, ensuring proper use of terminology and value sets. The IG provides detailed guidance on handling signatures, including the use of JWS and X.509 certificates. Implementers should also consider the specified data elements for associating attachments with claims or prior authorizations.

## Ecosystem Context

The CDex IG targets payer and provider systems, including EHRs, health information exchanges (HIEs), and other HIT systems involved in clinical data exchange. It is closely related to other Da Vinci IGs, such as HRex (for general health record exchange), US Core (for data elements and profiles), PAS (for prior authorization), CRD (for coverage requirements discovery), and DTR (for documentation templates and rules). The IG is relevant to U.S. jurisdiction and programs like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiatives. Primary use cases include requesting and sending attachments for claims and prior authorizations, requesting documentation for claims audits, exchanging clinical data between referring providers, and supporting payer operations like risk adjustment and quality reporting. The IG is designed to be used in conjunction with existing X12 transactions, particularly 275, 277, 278, 837I, and 837P.
