    "summary": "The Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, using it as the core standard for data representation and exchange. It leverages FHIR's RESTful API capabilities and resource model to define how death investigation data should be structured and shared. While it references and profiles other standards like US Core, VRDR, and VRCL, these are built upon FHIR, reinforcing FHIR's foundational role. The IG does not directly utilize CDA, v2, or v3, although it does reference v2 and v3 code systems within the FHIR context. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges FHIR with existing practices in the MDI domain, but it doesn't explicitly integrate different HL7 paradigms like v2 and v3.",

    "summary": "The FHIR Implementation Guide for Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) primarily focuses on standardizing the exchange of clinical data related to death investigations between various systems, including MDI case management systems, forensic toxicology labs, and electronic death registration systems. It heavily emphasizes the use of FHIR resources like Composition, DiagnosticReport, and Observation to structure this data. While it touches upon administrative aspects like tracking numbers and organizational details, its core purpose is to facilitate the flow of clinical information for death certification and related processes. Identity and security are addressed with recommendations for secure transport and access control. The IG also supports specific workflows like death certificate review and cremation clearance, and it has a clear connection to public health through its alignment with vital records reporting standards.",
