It does not use HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it leverage CDA for document exchange. While it aims to align with the Danish core profiles and the shared information model (FKI), it represents a specific subset for reporting, indicating some level of cross-paradigm awareness but not deep integration.",

  "Users & Stakeholders": {
    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on enabling Danish municipalities to report social care data to a central gateway. Therefore, the core users are the municipalities (represented in the analysis as Healthcare Administrators) and the central gateway. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations are also key users as they will utilize the aggregated data. Clinical Care Teams have a defined but limited role, as they are involved in the data collection process, but the IG is not directly designed for their use in delivering care. Government Agencies have a moderate role in setting standards and oversight. Patients and Caregivers, as well as Payers, are not meaningfully involved in this IG.",
