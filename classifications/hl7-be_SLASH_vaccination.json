  "rationale": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines standards for representing and exchanging vaccination data in Belgium. The core of the IG is the `BeVaccination` profile, which is a constrained version of the base FHIR `Immunization` resource. This profile mandates specific data elements and value sets relevant to the Belgian healthcare context. \n\nThe IG establishes several extensions to capture additional information, such as `BeAdministeredProduct`, `BeVaccinationConfirmationStatus`, and `BeExtRecorder`. These extensions provide a mechanism to record details about the administered product, the confirmation status of the vaccination, and the individual who recorded the event. \n\nFurthermore, the IG defines a set of code systems and value sets to ensure consistent terminology usage. For instance, `BeCSCareLocation` provides codes for different locations where vaccinations can be administered, while `BeVSVaccinationStatusReason` offers reasons for why a vaccination might not have been performed. \n\nIn addition to the core profile and extensions, the IG includes numerous examples demonstrating how to represent various vaccination scenarios using the defined standards. These examples cover a wide range of cases, including routine childhood vaccinations, COVID-19 vaccinations, and instances where vaccinations were not given due to various reasons. \n\nThe IG also defines two logical models, `BeModelVaccination` and `BeModelVaccinationReduced`, which provide a more abstract representation of the vaccination data. These models can be used for various purposes, such as data mapping and system design. \n\nOverall, this IG provides a comprehensive framework for standardizing vaccination data exchange in Belgium, leveraging FHIR resources, profiles, extensions, and terminology to ensure interoperability and data quality.",
