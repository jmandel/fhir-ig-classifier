    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on the FHIR standard, leveraging its resources, operations, and RESTful approach to define a specialized patient identity matching process. It does not utilize CDA, v2, or v3 directly, but acknowledges the broader HL7 ecosystem through references to other standards and IGs. The IG demonstrates a focused application of FHIR for a specific use case, with no significant integration across different HL7 paradigms.",

It leverages FHIR's `$match` operation and introduces specialized profiles and workflows for identity verification, assurance, and digital identity management. While it touches upon administrative and workflow aspects, its core purpose revolves around accurate patient identification and secure data exchange, making Identity & Security its central domain.",

EHR systems are central, needing to implement the $IDI-match operation and handle patient identity verification. Payer systems are also key players, using identity matching for claims processing and coverage determination. PHR systems will need to support patient-mediated data access and identity verification workflows. Public health and research systems have limited but clear roles in specific data exchange scenarios.

Payers also have a significant stake in accurate matching for claims processing and fraud prevention. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations can benefit from improved data linkage, while Patients and Caregivers benefit indirectly from improved data accuracy and access. Government Agencies have a minimal role, primarily related to alignment with broader initiatives like TEFCA.",
