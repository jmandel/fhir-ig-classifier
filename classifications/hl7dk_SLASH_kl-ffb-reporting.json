  "rationale": "The \"kl-ffb-reporting\" Implementation Guide defines a system for Danish municipalities to report social information from citizen journals to a centralized gateway. This data is intended for use in population-based studies and management information systems. The IG specifies a set of FHIR profiles that constrain the standard to meet the specific requirements of this reporting system. \n\nThe core functionality of this IG revolves around defining the structure and content of a \"Delivery Report,\" which is a FHIR Bundle containing resources related to a single citizen. These resources include Citizen, ServiceRequest, InformationGathering, CarePlan, InterventionGoal, FollowUpEncounter, Condition, CareEvaluation, TargetGroup, Intervention, ServicePerformer, and FollowUp. Each of these resources is profiled to restrict the allowed data elements and enforce specific validation rules. For example, the Condition profile mandates the use of specific FFB (FÃ¦lles Faglige Begreber) codes for conditions and severities, while the CarePlan profile requires a municipality case number and references to other resources like target groups and intervention goals. \n\nThe IG also defines specific extensions, such as KLReportingFFBMunicipalityCaseNumber and KLReportingFFBFollowUpDateExtension, to capture additional data elements not covered by the base FHIR standard. The validation rules defined in the profiles ensure data consistency and compliance with the FFB standard. The IG provides detailed examples of delivery reports for different scenarios, illustrating how the profiles are used in practice. \n\nIn essence, this IG focuses on data modeling by creating a set of FHIR profiles that define the structure and content of the data to be reported. It also touches upon data exchange by specifying that the delivery reports should be posted to a gateway, which then validates the data against the defined profiles. The IG primarily targets technical implementers, particularly EHR vendors and system integrators, who are responsible for implementing the reporting system in Danish municipalities. The geographic scope is clearly limited to Denmark, and the primary stakeholders are Danish healthcare provider organizations and public health organizations.",
