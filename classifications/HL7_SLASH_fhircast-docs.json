It heavily relies on FHIR for its data model, resource definitions, and interaction patterns. While it acknowledges other standards like CCOW, it doesn't directly integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. It does demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by leveraging concepts from WebSub and SMART on FHIR within a FHIR-centric approach.",
