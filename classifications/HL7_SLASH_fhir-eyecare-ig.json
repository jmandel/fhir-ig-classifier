    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for ophthalmology heavily relies on the FHIR standard for its core structure and functionality, defining profiles, extensions, and value sets based on FHIR resources. It does not utilize HL7 v2, v3, or CDA, focusing solely on a FHIR-based approach to data exchange. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and mention of potential integration with other FHIR profiles suggests a moderate level of cross-paradigm awareness.",
