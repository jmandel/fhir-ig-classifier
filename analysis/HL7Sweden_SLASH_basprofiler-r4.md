# basprofiler-r4: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to define base profiles and extensions for FHIR resources that are commonly used in Sweden. It provides a foundation for FHIR implementation in the Swedish healthcare context by specifying the minimum adjustments needed to the FHIR standard. It establishes a common ground for interoperability, enabling different systems to exchange data in a standardized way within Sweden. It is intended for use by implementers of FHIR systems in Sweden.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG provides explicit profiles and extensions for representing Swedish-specific data elements, such as personnummer (national identification number), samordningsnummer (coordination number), nationellt reservnummer (national reserve number), marital status codes from Skatteverket, official address types, and security labels. It also provides profiles for organizations and practitioners with Swedish specific identifiers and codes. It establishes a standardized way of representing these elements, addressing the need for interoperability by defining a minimum common denominator for FHIR implementations in Sweden. The IG also defines the use of extensions for middle names and own family names, which is specific to the Swedish context.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   **Profiles:** Defines profiles for Patient, Organization, and Practitioner resources, which constrain and extend the base FHIR resources.
    *   **Extensions:** Introduces extensions for middle names, own family names, and official address types.
    *   **Value Sets:** Provides value sets for marital status, official address types, organization types, practitioner roles, and security labels, drawing from both HL7 and Swedish national code systems like Skatteverket, Socialstyrelsen, and Inera.
    *   **Slicing:** Uses slicing for identifiers and codes to accommodate different types of identifiers and codes used in Sweden.
    *   **Code Systems:** Defines custom code systems for security labels and marital status.
    *   **Examples:** Includes example instances of Patient and Organization resources, demonstrating the application of the profiles.
    *   **RuleSets:** Utilizes a rule set for standardizing common settings.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG aligns with the FHIR standard but adapts it to the Swedish context, incorporating terminologies and identifiers used by Swedish authorities such as Skatteverket (tax agency), Socialstyrelsen (National Board of Health and Welfare), and Inera AB. It addresses specific Swedish legal requirements related to data privacy and security through the use of security labels. It also references national code systems like HSA (Health and Social Care) and SOSNYK (Socialstyrelsens nationella yrkeskodverk). The IG also mentions the use of Snomed CT for specific code selections within the practitioner profile.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users of this IG are:
    *   **System developers and vendors:** who are creating or adapting systems to work with Swedish healthcare data.
    *   **Healthcare organizations:** that need to exchange data using FHIR within Sweden.
    *   **Implementers:** who need a standardized way to represent Swedish patient data.

    While patients are not direct users of the IG, they indirectly benefit from it through improved data exchange, which can lead to better care coordination and more efficient healthcare services. The IG ensures that patient data is handled in a standardized way, which can improve data quality and patient safety.
