It heavily relies on FHIR's MeasureReport resource and defines specific profiles and extensions for this purpose. While it acknowledges C-CDA for data submission, it doesn't deeply integrate with CDA or v2/v3. The IG demonstrates a commitment to FHIR as its foundational standard and utilizes other HL7 standards minimally.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on standardizing the exchange of risk adjustment coding gap information between payers and providers. It leverages the MeasureReport resource to structure the reports and defines extensions for detailed Condition Category information. While it touches upon clinical data submission for gap closure, its primary drive is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the risk adjustment process, which is fundamentally tied to insurance and payment. The IG also introduces the concept of digital Condition Categories (dCCs) which hints at future integration with clinical knowledge and potentially care pathways, but this is not the core focus of the current version.",
