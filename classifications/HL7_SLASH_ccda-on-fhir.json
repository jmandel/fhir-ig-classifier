While it acknowledges C-CDA as the source format, it focuses on FHIR as the target representation. There's no mention of v2 or v3, and the cross-paradigm aspect is limited to the C-CDA to FHIR translation.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on bridging the gap between C-CDA and FHIR, primarily by defining mappings and profiles to represent C-CDA documents and their clinical content in FHIR. Therefore, it heavily emphasizes **Clinical Data** as its core domain. While it touches upon administrative aspects through document management and references US Core, the central goal is to facilitate the exchange and representation of clinical information. **Workflow** is also a key domain, as the IG addresses the process of transforming and exchanging documents. **Identity & Security** is addressed through extensions for elements like Authorization and Informant, but not as a central focus. Other domains like **Medications**, **Diagnostics**, and **Care Planning** are supported through mappings to relevant FHIR resources, but the IG's primary purpose is not to define new specifications in these areas, but rather to represent existing C-CDA content.",
