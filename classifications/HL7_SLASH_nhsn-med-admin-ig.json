    "summary": "This Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR for representing and exchanging medication administration data. It leverages FHIR's RESTful approach and resource model as its core mechanism. While it acknowledges CDA through its relationship with a related CDA IG, it does not directly utilize CDA structures or principles. There's no mention or implication of using HL7 v2 or v3. The IG does demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by relating to a CDA IG and building upon US Core, suggesting an awareness of the broader HL7 ecosystem.",

The design is driven by the needs of Public Health Agencies, specifically the CDC, to monitor medication use during public health emergencies. Clinical Care Teams are key users as they generate the data, while Government Agencies have a significant role in oversight and regulation. Research Organizations can leverage the collected data, and Healthcare Administrators are involved in implementing the IG within their institutions.",
