    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on defining a standardized approach for bulk data export using FHIR. It heavily relies on FHIR's RESTful API and resource model, utilizing the Asynchronous Request Pattern for managing long-running operations. While it acknowledges other standards like SMART on FHIR for security, it doesn't directly integrate with or depend on HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. The IG does demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by leveraging the FHIR Asynchronous Request Pattern, which is a general pattern applicable beyond just FHIR.",
