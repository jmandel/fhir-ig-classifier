  "rationale": "The US Core Implementation Guide is focused on defining the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data using FHIR. It is based on FHIR Version R4 and references the ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) and ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v1. The guide provides profiles, extensions, and value sets to standardize data exchange. The primary purpose is data modeling, defining core data models or profiles for specific domains or use cases. It also touches upon data exchange by defining search parameters and operations. The guide is intended for use in the US Realm and is primarily targeted towards technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and health IT development teams. It also defines guidance for specific clinical areas, such as clinical notes and medication lists. The guide does not focus on specialty care but rather provides a foundation for general clinical care across various settings. It also includes some aspects of infrastructure and foundational elements, such as security and terminology. The guide is heavily focused on data modeling, defining profiles, extensions, and value sets to represent patient data. It also touches upon data exchange by defining search parameters and operations, but the primary focus is on the structure and representation of the data itself. The guide also includes guidance on security and privacy, but it is not the main focus. The guide is intended for use in the United States and is developed by HL7 International, specifically the Cross-Group Projects workgroup. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and health IT development teams, as well as healthcare provider organizations, particularly their IT departments and clinical care teams. The guide also mentions the Argonaut pilot implementations, indicating a focus on real-world implementation and testing.",
