    "summary": "This Implementation Guide, C-CDA R3.0, primarily focuses on defining templates for clinical documents based on the HL7 CDA standard. While it leverages FHIR's tooling for template definition and validation, it does not utilize FHIR resources or APIs for data exchange. It does not directly involve HL7 v2 or v3, but rather builds upon the CDA standard, which itself is part of the broader HL7 v3 family. The IG acknowledges the need for cross-paradigm interoperability by using FHIR tooling to enhance the CDA standard.",
