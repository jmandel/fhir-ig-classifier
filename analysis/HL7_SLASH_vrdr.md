# vrdr: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) FHIR IG aims to modernize the exchange of mortality data between:

* **Jurisdictional Vital Records Offices (JVROs)**: State-level offices responsible for registering deaths.
* **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)**: A federal agency collecting and analyzing health data.

The IG focuses on standardizing data elements using FHIR resources for seamless exchange, improving timeliness and accuracy in death reporting while reducing costs.

**In simple terms:**  It creates a common language for computers to share death records between states and the federal government, making the process faster, more accurate, and less expensive.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The STU3 version of VRDR improves upon the previous STU2.2 version by:

* **Harmonization:** Aligning with the Vital Records Common Library FHIR IG, enabling reuse of resources in other vital records contexts, like the Medicolegal Death Investigation IG.
* **Enhanced Documentation:** Providing clearer explanations and examples for easier implementation.
* **Maternal Death Linkages:** Adding support for linking maternal death records to associated fetal death or birth records.
* **Coded Industry and Occupation Exchange:** Supporting the exchange of standardized industry and occupation codes.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

* **FHIR-Based Profiles:** Defines specialized profiles based on standard FHIR resources like Patient, Observation, and Location, tailored to death reporting requirements.
* **Bundles and Compositions:** Structures death records as FHIR Bundles containing a Composition resource (DeathCertificate) and related resources like Decedent (Patient) and CauseOfDeathPart1 (Observation).
* **Valuesets and Codesystems:** Employs standard and custom valuesets and codesystems to ensure consistent coding of data elements like MannerOfDeath and PlaceOfInjury.
* **IJE Mapping:** Provides a detailed mapping between the existing Interjurisdictional Exchange (IJE) format and the FHIR profiles, facilitating transition for existing users.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The VRDR IG aligns with:

* **HL7 FHIR Standard:** The foundation for interoperable healthcare data exchange.
* **US Core Profiles:** Leverages US Core profiles for common data elements like Patient and Practitioner, ensuring broader interoperability.
* **Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP):**  Adheres to VSCP reporting requirements for death records.
* **U.S. Standard Certificate of Death:**  The IG's content is based on this standard form, ensuring consistency with existing practices.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

* **Jurisdictional Vital Records Offices (JVROs):**  Benefit from standardized data exchange with NCHS and other jurisdictions.
* **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS):**  Receives timely and accurate mortality data for public health surveillance and analysis.
* **Public Health Researchers and Policy Makers:**  Access reliable mortality data for research, policy development, and resource allocation.
* **Individuals (indirectly):**  Improved data quality and timeliness can benefit individuals through better public health initiatives and informed decision-making.
