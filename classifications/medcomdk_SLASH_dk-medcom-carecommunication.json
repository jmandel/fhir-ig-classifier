    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on FHIR, defining a message-based communication pattern for non-acute care in Denmark. It leverages FHIR resources and profiles extensively. While it acknowledges older standards like DIS91/XDIS91 (likely based on v2 or v3) for backward compatibility in specific scenarios, it doesn't directly integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is minimal, primarily focused on bridging the gap between FHIR and the older standards it replaces.",

Therefore, it is classified as a National Implementation Guide for Denmark.",

It primarily addresses the workflow of message-based communication, including sending, replying, and forwarding messages with attachments. While it touches upon clinical data through message content and patient context, its core purpose is to facilitate communication rather than to manage or exchange detailed clinical information. Identity and security are crucial for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged information. The IG is designed for the Danish healthcare context and replaces older communication standards.",
