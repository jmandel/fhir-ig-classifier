It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it directly leverage CDA. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, it does build upon and extend existing FHIR profiles and resources, demonstrating a degree of cross-paradigm influence within the FHIR ecosystem.",

Patients and Caregivers are important as they are the subjects of the data and may interact with systems using this IG. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations can leverage the standardized data for population health and research purposes, respectively. Payers and Government Agencies have a less direct role, primarily related to policy, regulation, and potential future use cases like quality measurement and value-based payment models.",
