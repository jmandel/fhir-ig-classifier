  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-directory-attestation\" primarily focuses on defining the processes and mechanisms for attesting to and verifying healthcare directory information within the context of a national healthcare directory. It leverages FHIR resources and operations to achieve this. \n\n**Attestation:** The IG outlines how authorized entities (individuals, organizations, or their representatives) can submit information about themselves, their roles, and relationships for inclusion in the directory. This involves using FHIR resources like Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Organization, OrganizationAffiliation, Location, Endpoint, and HealthcareService to represent the attested data. The IG suggests using a FHIR API for managing the attestation process, although it acknowledges that other methods might be used.\n\n**Verification:** The IG emphasizes the importance of verifying the attested data against primary sources to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness. It introduces the VerificationResult resource to record information about the verification process, including the primary source, verification status, and dates. The IG suggests defining APIs for primary sources to interact with the verification process, although it acknowledges that other methods like manual verification might be used.\n\n**Data Exchange:** While the primary focus is on attestation and verification, the IG also touches upon data exchange. It mentions the use of FHIR APIs for querying and retrieving validated directory data, and it references the National Directory Exchange IG for more details on exchange mechanisms. It also briefly discusses bulk data exchange and subscriptions as potential methods for sharing directory information.\n\n**Security and Privacy:** The IG includes a Restriction profile based on the Consent resource to convey any restrictions associated with data elements or resources obtained from the directory. This is intended to address the potential presence of sensitive information in the directory.\n\n**Scope:** The IG is designed for a US national context, as indicated by references to ONC, FHA, and US Core. However, it aims to be broadly applicable and acknowledges that implementations may vary based on specific business needs and contexts.\n\nIn summary, the \"fhir-directory-attestation\" IG primarily defines data models and processes for attestation and verification of healthcare directory information, with a secondary focus on data exchange, security, and privacy. It leverages FHIR resources and operations to achieve these goals within a US national context.",
