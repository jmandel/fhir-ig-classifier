  "rationale": "The UDS+ FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining the mechanisms for submitting de-identified patient-level data from health centers to HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) for UDS (Uniform Data System) reporting. The IG specifies the use of FHIR APIs, particularly leveraging the Bulk Data Access IG and SMART App Launch IG for Backend Services Authorization, to facilitate this data exchange. \n\nThe core functionality of this IG revolves around defining how data should be extracted from EHRs, de-identified, packaged, and transmitted to HRSA. It outlines specific requirements for Data Sources (e.g., EHRs), Data Submitters, Trust Service Providers (for de-identification), and Data Receivers (HRSA). The IG defines new FHIR profiles (e.g., `uds-plus-import-manifest`, `uds-plus-patient-reporting-parameters`) and modifies existing ones to support UDS+ reporting needs, including handling de-identification and specifying data elements for various UDS tables. It also details the `$import` operation for submitting data and the use of NDJSON for data formatting. \n\nThe IG emphasizes the use of FHIR R4 as the underlying standard and aligns with US Core profiles where possible, although it deviates in cases where UDS+ requirements differ. It also references the QI Core and DEQM IGs for quality measure reporting. The geographic scope is centered on the United States, as it addresses HRSA's UDS reporting requirements, which are specific to US health centers. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers (EHR vendors, system integrators) and healthcare provider organizations, particularly those involved in UDS reporting. Public health organizations are also key stakeholders, as HRSA, a public health agency, is the recipient of the data. The IG also touches upon administrative aspects, as UDS reporting has implications for funding and performance evaluation.",
