    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on creating a standardized library of reusable FHIR resources for vital records data exchange, primarily between jurisdictions and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It emphasizes demographic and person-related data elements common across vital events like birth, death, and fetal death. While it touches upon administrative aspects related to vital records, its core purpose is to define the data structure and content, not the processes or workflows. Therefore, it heavily emphasizes clinical data related to vital events, with a strong connection to public health for population-level health monitoring through vital statistics.",
