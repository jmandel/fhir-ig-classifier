    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on standardizing Adverse Event (AE) data in clinical research using FHIR. It heavily relies on the FHIR standard for its core structure and data exchange, with no significant dependence on other HL7 standards like CDA, v2, or v3. While it acknowledges the broader HL7 ecosystem and potential for future integration (e.g., with a MedWatch IG), its current scope is firmly rooted in FHIR.",

While it leverages core FHIR standards and is designed for broad applicability within the clinical research domain, it explicitly references US FDA regulations and guidelines (e.g., FDA E2B(R3), MedWatch) and anticipates a future MedWatch IG, indicating a strong alignment with US needs. However, it does not explicitly state that it is governed by the US as its primary scope. Therefore, it is scored as 0.8 for National > United States.",
