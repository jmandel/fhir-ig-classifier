# fhir-registry-protocols-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to standardize the way clinical data is submitted to registries. It provides a framework for defining how data from various sources should be mapped, transformed, and validated before being submitted to a registry. The context is clinical data submission, and the primary users are organizations that submit data to registries, such as hospitals and healthcare systems. The objective is to improve interoperability and data quality in registry submissions.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG introduces a structured approach using FHIR to define data mapping, transformation, and validation for registry submissions. It leverages FHIR profiles, logical models, and OperationDefinitions to create a more standardized and flexible submission process. The use of CapabilityStatements with slices allows for more specific requirements for different actors. There is explicit mapping guidance for FHIR, CDA, and HL7 v2 standards, which is a significant improvement over ad-hoc or proprietary approaches.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   **Logical Models:** Defining a logical model to represent the data required for a submission, along with mappings to different data standards (FHIR, CDA, HL7v2).
    *   **CapabilityStatements with Slices:** Using CapabilityStatements with slicing to define specific requirements for different actors (e.g., Registry Submitter, Registry Repository).
    *   **OperationDefinition:** Defining a specific operation for uploading NDJSON files to handle large data submissions.
    *   **CREDSSubmission Bundle:** Defining a specific profile for the submission bundle.
    *   **CREDSOperationOutcome:** Defining a specific profile for the validation responses.
    *   **RuleSets:** Using rule sets for common definition content, structure definitions, and capability statement content.
    *   **ValueSets and CodeSystems:** Defining specific ValueSets and CodeSystems used in the models and validation processes.
    *   **Mappings:** Defining how data elements from different data standards (FHIR, CDA, HL7v2) are mapped to the logical model and output resources.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG is built upon the FHIR standard, which is widely used for healthcare interoperability. It also references other standards like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and HL7 v2, indicating its intent to work within the broader healthcare data exchange ecosystem. There is a specific focus on US Core profiles, indicating an alignment with US healthcare standards. By standardizing submissions, it aims to improve data quality and consistency, which is crucial for compliance with various healthcare regulations.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are:
    *   **Registry Submission Definition Creators:** Those who define the requirements for data submission to a specific registry.
    *   **Registry Submission Definition Repositories:** Those who host the definitions for registry submissions.
    *   **Registry Submitters:** Organizations (hospitals, healthcare systems) that submit data to registries.
    *   **Registry Submission Data Sources:** Systems that provide data to registry submitters.
    *   **Registry Submission Consumers:** Registries that receive and process the submitted data.

    While patients are not directly interacting with the system defined by this IG, they are indirect beneficiaries.  The IG aims to improve data quality and consistency, which will lead to more accurate and reliable research and better clinical care.
