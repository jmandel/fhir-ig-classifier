  "rationale": "The IHE RAD.IMR Implementation Guide focuses on defining the structure and exchange mechanisms for interactive multimedia reports within the radiology domain. It specifies how diagnostic reports with interactive multimedia content can be encoded, communicated, and presented using FHIR resources. \n\nConcretely, this IG defines:\n\n1.  **FHIR Profiles:** It creates specific profiles for `DiagnosticReport`, `ServiceRequest`, `ImagingStudy`, and `Endpoint` resources tailored to the needs of interactive multimedia reporting in radiology. These profiles constrain the standard FHIR resources to define how they should be used in this specific context, including required elements, value sets, and extensions.\n2.  **Transactions:** It defines four new transactions: `Store Multimedia Report [RAD-141]`, `Display Multimedia Report [RAD-142]`, `Find Multimedia Report [RAD-143]`, and `Retrieve Rendered Multimedia Report [RAD-144]`. These transactions specify the interactions between actors like `Report Creator`, `Report Repository`, `Report Reader`, and `Rendered Report Reader` for storing, querying, retrieving, and displaying interactive multimedia reports.\n3.  **Bundle Profile:** It defines a profile for a FHIR `Bundle` resource used in the `Store Multimedia Report` transaction. This bundle contains the `DiagnosticReport` and related resources like `ServiceRequest` and `ImagingStudy`.\n4.  **CapabilityStatements:** It includes `CapabilityStatement` resources for the actors involved, outlining the required and optional functionalities for each.\n5.  **Content Organization:** It specifies how to map common radiology report attributes to elements within the `DiagnosticReport` resource and other referenced resources. It also defines how to include a rendered report (e.g., in HTML or PDF format) within the `DiagnosticReport`.\n6.  **Observation Imaging Context:** It details how to represent inline image references within the narrative text of the report using `<span>` elements and references to `ImagingSelection` resources. It also specifies how to construct URLs for these hyperlinks to enable interactive viewing of the referenced images.\n\nIn essence, RAD.IMR provides a detailed blueprint for creating, exchanging, and consuming interactive multimedia reports in a standardized way using FHIR, enhancing the richness and usability of radiology reports.",
