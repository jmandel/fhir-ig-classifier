  "rationale": "The dk-medcom-terminology Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining and managing terminologies used within the Danish healthcare sector, specifically for MedCom's FHIR standards. It defines CodeSystems, ValueSets, and ConceptMaps. \n\nThe IG includes CodeSystems that declare the existence of codes and their meanings, such as `MedComMessagingActivityCodes`, which defines activities related to messages (e.g., new-message, admit-inpatient). It also defines ValueSets that specify sets of codes from one or more CodeSystems for use in specific contexts, like `MedComHospitalNotificationMessageActivityCodes` for hospital notification message activities and `MedComCareCommunicationMessageActivityCodes` for care communication message activities. Additionally, it includes ConceptMaps that define mappings between different sets of concepts, such as `MedComMessagingMapFhirToSorEdi`, which maps MedCom FHIR message names to SOREDI message names.\n\nThe IG provides these terminologies for online viewing and download in various formats, including autogenerated examples in XML and JSON. It also includes a downloadable copy of ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps in npm format. The governance of these terminologies, including updating, maintaining, and versioning, is described, and a mechanism for users to receive notifications about updates is provided through the GitHub repository.\n\nWhile the IG references other MedCom FHIR standards like CareCommunication, HospitalNotification, and Acknowledgement, its primary purpose is to define and manage the terminologies used within these standards, not to define the standards themselves. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for use within Denmark, as indicated by the jurisdiction specified in the configuration file.",
