EHR systems are central to its implementation, as they will be responsible for creating, populating, rendering, and extracting data from SDC-conformant forms. Clinical Decision Support systems will leverage the structured data captured via SDC for providing guidance and alerts. Research Platforms will utilize SDC for standardized data collection in clinical trials. Public Health Systems will benefit from SDC for streamlined reporting and surveillance. PHR systems may incorporate SDC for patient-reported outcomes. While Lab, Imaging, Pharmacy, and Payer systems have minimal direct involvement, they might indirectly interact with data captured through SDC.",
