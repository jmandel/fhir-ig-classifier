  "rationale": "The Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR) FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining the data model and exchange mechanisms for birth and fetal death reporting in the United States. It is based on FHIR R4 and defines a set of profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems to represent the data elements required for reporting births and fetal deaths to vital records jurisdictions and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The IG includes detailed mappings to the Inter-Jurisdictional Exchange (IJE) format, which is the current standard for vital records data exchange. The IG also provides guidance on how to represent various clinical and demographic data elements related to the mother, fetus/newborn, and the delivery encounter. The IG addresses topics such as pregnancy risk factors, maternal morbidities, labor and delivery characteristics, congenital anomalies, and cause of fetal death. It also defines bundles and compositions for packaging and exchanging birth and fetal death reports. The IG is intended to be used by EHR vendors, healthcare providers, public health agencies, and other stakeholders involved in the collection and reporting of birth and fetal death data. The IG is published by HL7 International, specifically the Public Health Workgroup, and is intended for use within the United States.",
