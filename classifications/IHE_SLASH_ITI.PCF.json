Therefore, Identity & Security is the core domain, with Clinical Data being a key domain due to the focus on controlling access to specific data elements.

    "summary": "The ITI PCF Implementation Guide focuses on managing and enforcing patient privacy consents in a FHIR-based environment. It primarily impacts systems involved in storing, managing, and enforcing access to patient data based on consent. EHR systems are central to this process, as they often serve as the primary source of patient data and need to enforce consent restrictions. Systems that manage patient identity and authorization, such as those implementing IUA, are also heavily involved. Payer systems have a defined role related to the purpose of use for payment. PHR systems may need to display and potentially manage consent information. Public health and research platforms may need to respect consent restrictions when accessing data. Clinical decision support, imaging, and lab systems have minimal direct involvement, although they may indirectly be affected by consent restrictions on data access.",
