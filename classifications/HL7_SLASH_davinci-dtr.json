    "summary": "The Da Vinci DTR Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, using it to define its core structure, operations, and data exchange mechanisms. It leverages FHIR Questionnaires and related resources extensively. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, they are not directly used or integrated within the IG's scope. The IG does not use v2 or v3, and while it mentions the possibility of integrating with CDA documents in the future, it does not currently support or require CDA. Cross-paradigm integration is not a primary focus, as the IG is firmly rooted in the FHIR paradigm.",
