    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally based on FHIR, using the CodeSystem resource as its foundation for representing terminology change sets. It leverages FHIR's extension mechanism extensively to accommodate terminology-specific attributes, particularly for SNOMED CT and LOINC. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it doesn't directly integrate or depend on them. The IG demonstrates a strong focus on FHIR's RESTful principles and resource model, making it a pure FHIR implementation.",

It defines a ChangeSet profile based on CodeSystem to capture additions, modifications, and deletions of concepts, designations, and properties. It also includes a Provenance profile to track the origin and context of the change set. The IG's primary purpose is to facilitate the consistent and accurate propagation of terminology updates across different systems, supporting terminology management and versioning. Therefore, it heavily emphasizes the structure and semantics of clinical terminologies, making Clinical Knowledge its core domain.",
