It heavily leverages CDS Hooks and SMART on FHIR, which are themselves extensions of the FHIR standard, indicating a deep integration with FHIR's ecosystem. While it acknowledges and utilizes US Core profiles, it doesn't directly interact with or depend on v2, v3, or CDA standards. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it combines different FHIR-based technologies (CDS Hooks, SMART), but not in the broader sense of bridging FHIR with older HL7 standards.",
