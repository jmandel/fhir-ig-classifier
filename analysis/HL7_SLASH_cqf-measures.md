# cqf-measures: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG), "Quality Measure Implementation Guide (QM IG)", focuses on the standardized representation of electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) using FHIR R4, Clinical Quality Language (CQL) R1.5.2, and QI-Core STU6. It addresses the primary interoperability challenge of enabling consistent, computable, and shareable definitions of quality measures across different systems and stakeholders. The IG solves key clinical and business problems by providing a framework for automating quality measurement, reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and facilitating data exchange for quality reporting and improvement initiatives. Its scope is primarily within the US Realm, but the concepts are broadly applicable. The IG is bounded to the specification of quality measures and does not cover measure reporting, which is addressed by the Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) IG.

## Technical Foundation

The technical foundation of this IG rests on FHIR R4, leveraging the `Measure` and `Library` resources as core building blocks. Key profiles include `CQFMComputableMeasure`, `CQFMPublishableMeasure`, `CQFMExecutableMeasure`, and measure scoring-specific profiles like `CQFMProportionMeasure`. Notable extensions include `cqfm-populationBasis`, `cqfm-criteriaReference`, and `cqfm-improvementNotation`. The IG defines operations like `CQFM Package` for packaging measures and their dependencies. It utilizes standard terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and defines custom value sets such as `Subject Type` and `Intended Venue`. Significant constraints include the use of CQL 1.5.2 for logic representation, specific naming conventions for population criteria, and requirements for including terminology and data requirements in libraries.

## Technical Essence

This IG defines a FHIR R4-based framework for representing eCQMs using `Measure` and `Library` resources. Measures are defined with metadata, terminology, population criteria, and data criteria sections. The `CQFMComputableMeasure` profile mandates a `populationBasis` extension to specify the type of population criteria results (e.g., boolean, Encounter).  Logic is expressed in CQL 1.5.2, contained within `Library` resources conforming to `CQLLibrary` or `ELMLibrary` profiles, and referenced from `Measure.group.population.criteria`.  The `Measure.library` element links to the primary CQL library.  `Measure.group` elements define population groups, with `population` elements specifying criteria like initial population, denominator, and numerator using `code` and `criteria` elements. The `criteria` element references a CQL expression by identifier using `language` set to `text/cql-identifier`.  Value sets and codes are declared in CQL and referenced in `dataRequirement` elements within the `Library`.  The `cqfm-criteriaReference` extension links measure observations to specific populations.  Measure packages, created via the `$package` operation, bundle the `Measure`, primary `Library`, dependent libraries, and optionally, terminology and test cases.  The `crmi-manifestlibrary` profile supports defining a set of measures with versioned dependencies.

## Implementation Approach

The IG is meant to be implemented by measure authoring tools, measure developers, and systems that consume and evaluate quality measures. Critical workflows include authoring measures using CQL, packaging measures and their dependencies, and distributing them to consuming systems. The IG emphasizes the use of the `Measure` and `Library` resources, with specific profiles and extensions to ensure consistency and computability. Key requirements include the use of CQL 1.5.2, adherence to specific naming conventions for population criteria, and the inclusion of terminology and data requirements in libraries. The IG promotes a modular approach, separating shareable, computable, publishable, and executable aspects of measures.

## Ecosystem Context

The primary target systems for this IG are measure authoring tools, quality measure repositories, and systems that evaluate and report on quality measures, such as EHRs and data aggregation platforms. The intended users include measure developers, informaticists, clinicians, and quality improvement professionals. The IG is closely related to the Clinical Quality Framework (CQF), Clinical Quality Language (CQL) specification, QI-Core, and DEQM IGs. It is relevant to jurisdictions and programs in the US Realm, such as CMS quality reporting programs. The primary use cases include authoring, publishing, distributing, evaluating, and reporting on quality measures to support quality improvement initiatives, value-based care, and public health surveillance.
