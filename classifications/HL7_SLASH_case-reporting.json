    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on electronic case reporting (eCR) using FHIR. It heavily relies on FHIR for its core structure and operations, defining FHIR profiles, extensions, and transactions for eICR, RR, and eRSD. While it acknowledges CDA through its relationship with previous CDA-based IGs, it doesn't actively utilize CDA structures. The IG doesn't use v2 or v3 directly. It demonstrates a degree of cross-paradigm awareness by referencing prior CDA work and aiming for future alignment with the US Public Health Library, but its primary focus is on FHIR.",

The primary goal is to improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting data for public health surveillance, outbreak management, and control. While it touches upon clinical data and workflow, its core is driven by public health needs and the exchange of information between healthcare providers and public health entities.",
