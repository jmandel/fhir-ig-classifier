# fetal_records: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to provide guidelines for handling and communicating data related to a fetus during pregnancy using FHIR. It addresses the lack of consistent rules for representing fetus data, which is often treated as either maternal data or not consistently identified as a separate entity. The context is the communication of data between different IT systems used in obstetrics and child health, such as EHRs, ultrasound systems, and lab systems. The target audience is IT developers working on these systems, as well as stakeholders like healthcare providers and governmental institutions. The goal is to facilitate the exchange of fetus-related data between systems with consistency.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    The IG improves upon previous approaches by establishing a consistent method for representing a fetus as a distinct subject using a simplified Patient resource with a "fetal status" extension.  Previously, fetus data might have been inconsistently recorded as maternal data or as a body tissue of the mother. The IG emphasizes relating data to the correct subject: mother, fetus, or pregnancy. It also addresses the need for persistent identifiers for fetuses, especially in cases of multiple pregnancies, and clarifies how to relate data to the fetus in various FHIR resources. The IG promotes clarity on how to represent fetus data in FHIR resources in a consistent manner across different systems, which simplifies integration and data comparison.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features of this IG include the use of a Patient resource with a "fetalStatus" extension to represent a fetus. The IG emphasizes the use of `RelatedPerson` resources to express the relationship between the fetus and the mother. It also suggests the use of persistent identifiers for fetuses, and it provides guidance on how to relate various types of data (observations, conditions, procedures, and medication requests) to the correct subject (mother, fetus, or pregnancy) within FHIR resources. The IG also addresses how to handle the "mustSupport" elements in the profiles. It provides three use cases for scenarios: medication request, result reporting, and data transfer. The IG also provides detailed profiles for the `IBCMFetalPatient`, and uses aliases for codesystems.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    The IG acknowledges that it cannot dictate how data is stored in systems, and that it does not attempt to overlap or cause confusion with national birth and fetal death reporting standards. Instead, it focuses on the informational aspect of data handling and communication between systems in the context of pregnancy and birth healthcare. The IG uses standard FHIR resources and aims to provide a consistent way to represent fetal data, which would facilitate interoperability and data exchange. It also references the US BFDR (Birth and Fetal Death Reporting) IG, indicating an awareness of existing related efforts.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users of this IG are IT developers and implementers who are building or maintaining systems in child health and obstetrics sectors. Secondary users include healthcare providers (such as midwives, obstetricians, and neonatologists), paramedical staff (such as ultrasound and lab technicians), and governmental institutions involved in data collection and research. While patients are not direct users of this IG, the ultimate beneficiaries are both mothers and fetuses, as the consistent use of this guide can lead to improved data collection, better communication between healthcare providers, and ultimately improved care. The IG aims to make it easier to track and manage data related to the fetus during pregnancy.
