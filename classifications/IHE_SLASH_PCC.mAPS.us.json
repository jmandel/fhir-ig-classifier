  "rationale": "The `PCC.mAPS.us` FHIR Implementation Guide defines a structure for aggregating and representing antepartum care information, specifically tailored for the US healthcare context. It primarily focuses on creating a standardized \"Antepartum Summary\" document, which is a specialized FHIR Composition resource. This summary includes essential clinical data such as estimated due dates, visit summaries, allergies, advance directives, care plans, and selected patient histories. \n\nThe IG defines several new FHIR profiles, including a US-specific Antepartum Summary Composition profile (`IHE.PCC.APS.Composition.US`), which inherits from a more general `IHE.PCC.APS.Composition` profile. It also defines or references numerous Observation profiles for specific antepartum data points like gestational age, fetal measurements, lab results, and social history elements. These profiles constrain existing FHIR resources to fit the specific needs of antepartum care documentation. \n\nAdditionally, the IG provides example instances of these profiles, demonstrating how they can be used to represent real-world clinical data. It specifies conformance expectations using Must Support flags, indicating which data elements are required in a conformant Antepartum Summary. The IG also includes sections on test plans, changes to other IHE specifications, and download options for the defined resources. While it references external dependencies like US Core and ODH, the core of this IG is the definition of the Antepartum Summary composition and its associated profiles for representing structured clinical data within the US realm.",
