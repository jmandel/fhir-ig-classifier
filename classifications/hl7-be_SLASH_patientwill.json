It leverages the FHIR Consent resource to document patient preferences regarding medical treatments, resuscitation, hospitalization, and other end-of-life decisions. While it touches upon administrative aspects through patient and recorder identification, its core purpose revolves around care planning and ensuring respect for patient autonomy in critical care situations. It also has a minor focus on clinical data and research through the inclusion of provisions for recording agreement to participate in clinical trials.",
