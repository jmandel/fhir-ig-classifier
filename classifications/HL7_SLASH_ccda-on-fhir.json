    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally about translating between C-CDA and FHIR. It heavily relies on FHIR and its resources to represent C-CDA documents. While it acknowledges C-CDA as the source format, it doesn't deeply integrate with CDA's structural elements beyond mapping them to FHIR. There's a deliberate effort to bridge the two standards, indicating a cross-paradigm approach. v2 and v3 are not relevant to the IG's core purpose.",
