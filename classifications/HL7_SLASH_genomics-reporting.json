    "summary": "The genomics-reporting Implementation Guide primarily focuses on standardizing the representation and exchange of clinical genomic testing results using HL7 FHIR. It heavily emphasizes the structure of clinical data related to genomics, including variants, haplotypes, genotypes, and their clinical implications. It also touches upon aspects of diagnostics, workflow, and clinical knowledge related to genomic testing. While it mentions research and population-level queries, the core design is driven by clinical reporting needs.",
