Payers are a key user group, as the IG facilitates streamlined auditing and billing. Healthcare Administrators and Patients/Caregivers also benefit from improved data organization and accessibility. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations have a defined but limited role, potentially using the structured data for population health analysis and research. Government Agencies have minimal involvement, primarily related to oversight of standards compliance.",
