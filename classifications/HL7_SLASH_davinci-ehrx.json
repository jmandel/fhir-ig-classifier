It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 directly, nor does it focus on CDA document exchange. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and its definition of profiles and operations that could potentially be mapped to other standards suggests a moderate level of cross-paradigm awareness.",

While it touches upon clinical data exchange, its core purpose revolves around establishing a foundational framework for interoperability rather than deep clinical data modeling or care planning. The IG also supports workflow through asynchronous data requests using Task resources and touches upon payment and financial aspects through its focus on payer-provider interactions.",
