# CapStatement
FHIR CapabilityStatement generation via python script and Jinja template

Modified from: Eric Haas tool available at: https://github.com/Healthedata1/MyNotebooks/blob/master/CapStatement/R4CapStatement_Maker.ipynb

This tool is mostly adaptations of Eric's great original work.

## Getting Started

Dependecies: 
    fhirclient 
    pandas
    xlrd
    openpyxl
    stringcase
    jinja2
    commonmark
    lxml


To install all dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
to run on windows: `python -m pip ...`

NOTE: fhirclient can be installed via pip or copied from this repository (note that fhirclient is not being maintained in this respository)
The fhirclient requires the r4models to be installed (also included in this repository in the fhirclient folder. These modified R4 models need to be installed with the fhirclient pip site-package in [installdir]/lib/python/site-packages/fhirclient


## Genertate CapabilityStatement with Narrative from xslx file

Usage: `python3 R4CapStatement_Maker.py [xlsx file]`

## Genertate CapabilityStatement Narrative from existing CapabilityStatement

Usage: `python3 R4CapStatement_NarrativeMaker.py [json file] {[Artifacts Folder]}`

Currently creates a new CapabilityStatement json file prefixed with "Narrative-" 

Artifacts folder is optional. It is the location of the locally (pre)built FHIR IG artifacts (output folder). This is used to retrieve the names (title) of artifacts to use as the link text in the generated narrative. 
For any artifacts for which a name was not retrieved (e.g. no artifact folder provided or externally defined references), the script will attempt to retrieve the artifact (and name) using the artifact's specified url.


## Future Plans

Clean up beyond quick and dirty tool.

Merge the two scripts into one script.

Potentially merge with other tooling (including from Eric Haas) to create a single toolset.

### FHIR Security and Privacy Guidance
<p>Security and privacy are critical aspects to consider with any interface where data, like that described in this Implementation Guide, is shared or otherwise made accessible. Implementers of this Implementation Guide should make sure their APIs are secure in accordance with guidance defined in the FHIR standard where applicable: </p>

* The FHIR Security specification provides guidance related to communication security, authentication, authorization/access control, audit, digital signatures, attachments, labels, narrative, and input validation. The FHIR security specification is available <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/security.html">here</a>
* The FHIR Security and Privacy Module describes access control and authorization considerations to protect a FHIR server, how to document permissions granted, and how to keep records of performed events. The FHIR Security and privacy module can be found <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/secpriv-module.html">here</a>
* The FHIR Implementerâ€™s Safety Checklist helps implementers be sure that they have considered all the parts of FHIR that impact their system design regarding privacy, security, provenance, and safety. The FHIR safety check list is available <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/safety.html">here</a>

### Legal and Regulatory Requirements
<p>Implementers must ensure that APIs fully and successfully implement privacy and security features such as, but not limited to, those required to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements and other applicable law protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. Note that the HIPAA regulations apply only to HIPAA covered entities and their business associates. After information leaves the control of an entity covered under HIPAA, the HIPAA regulations do not apply. FTC consumer protection laws and other state and federal laws may apply.</p>

### SMART on FHIR Application Launch
<p>Client applications and Payers SHALL support the standalone launch sequence (launch/Patient) of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html">SMART App Launch framework</a> for user authorization and client authentication. Payers SHALL publish their authorization and token endpoints for discovery in accordance with the SMART App Launch framework. If the app needs to authenticate the identity of the end-user, it MAY include two OpenID Connect scopes: openid and fhirUser. When these scopes are requested, and the request is granted, the app MAY receive an id token along with the access token.</p>

### Authorization and Authentication
<p>The use of this Implementation Guide is predicated on client applications being registered with a payerâ€™s system of record in order to retrieve a client_id and client_secret for API access. The registration process is outside the scope of this IG. </p>

<p>This IG is also predicated on an insurance plan member (or their personal representative) consenting for their data to be shared with a consumer-facing application. This process follows the SMART on FHIR protocols linked above and typically involves the member (or their personal representative) agreeing to the terms of service and privacy policies of both the insurance plan and the consuming application before the data exchange takes place.</p>

### Introduction
<p>This Implementation Guide was born out of the CARIN Alliance Payer's Implementer Forum where representatives from major health insurance companies in the US come together to collaborate on FHIR server implementation. In 2020, participants of the forum indicated a need for better guidance on how to represent the full data elements found on physical insurance cards within a FHIR-based transaction. In particular, participating payers noted the following challenges when trying to build out FHIR Coverage resources including all the necessary data elements:</p>

* The base Coverage resource allows for representation of the patient for whom the Coverage resource pertains as well as the subscriber. There is not a standard way to represent all of the beneficiaries for the plan and their corresponding member IDs the way they would be found on a physical insurance card.
* The Coverage resource "network" field allows for only one single string. There is a need to allow for a unique identifier for the network as well as a consumer-friendly name which is often printed on the physical insurance card.
* The Coverage resource does not allow for expression of copays in the form of text strings. Some copays are able to represented as the required SimpleQuantity or Money data types while others require strings.
* There is a need to standardize how images often found on insurance cards are able to be expressed in a FHIR-based transaction in a way that is predictable and renderable by consuming applications.

While STU 1.0.0 focused on a FHIR API-based exchange of digital insurance cards, in 2023, the need was identified to create portable, verifiable versions of digital insurance cards. In [version 1.1.0], the IG was expanded to include support for SMART Health Links.


### Overview
<p>Payers can leverage the Coverage resource, the Organization resource, and the Patient resource to represent the essential information found on the physicial insurance card. This Implementation Guide creates 3 FHIR profiles to enable the standardized exchange of this information. The purpose of each profile is as follows:</p>

* C4DIC Coverage: The CARIN for Digital Insurance Card profile for the Coverage resource communicates the insurance plan information 
* C4DIC Organization: The CARIN for Digital Insurance Card profile for the Organization resource communicates the contact information for the plan (often found on the back of the physical insurance card)
* C4DIC Patient: The CARIN for Digital Insurance Card profile for the Patient resource communicates additional demographic information such as date of birth for the member whose data is being retrieved

<p>The below diagram outlines how these profiles relate. As shown below, the coverage.payor field will contain a reference to the corresponding Organization resource, and the coverage.beneficiary field will contain a reference to the corresponding Patient resource for the member whose data is being retrieved.</p>

<p><img style="width: 85%; float: none; align: middle;" src="ResourceDiagram.png"/></p>

### Additional Information

<p>For additional information about the exchange of insurance card information please visit these pages:</p>

* <a href="Use_Case.html">Use Case</a>
* <a href="Physical_Insurance_Card_Data_Elements.html">Physical Insurance Card Data Elements</a>

### Boundaries

<p>This Implementation Guide enables the digital exchange and digital rendering of the elements found on a personâ€™s physical insurance card. The primary use case is to support insurance members who wish to retrieve their current proof of insurance coverage digitally via a consumer-facing application. </p>
<p>This IG does NOT address eligibility checks between health providers and the insurance company. </p>
<p>Prescription benefit information is addressed in this implementation guide, but it does not replace pharmacy-specific benefit card standards, i.e. NCPDP standards, and is being provided to augment existing physical insurance cards where pharmacy benefits may need to be included with other coverage.</p>
<p>In keeping with the 80/20 rule, this IG does not solve for all possible insurance card data elements. If additional data elements of interest are identified by the community, they will be integrated in STU2 of this IG. For example, there are a few unique fields relevant to Medicare cards that were unable to be incorporated into this initial IG development cycle (i.e. CMS Contract Number, PBP Code, Segment ID). </p>

#### Home Page
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/index.html](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/index.html)
Update the intro to reflect the SHL use case.

1.1 Introduction
This implementation guide describes the CARIN for Digital Insurance Card (C4DIC) Framework, providing a set of resources that payers can display to consumers via a FHIR API or SMART Health Link. This implementation guide focuses on standardizing how data elements from the physical insurance card can be transmitted in a FHIR-based exchange, leveraging the Coverage resource as well as Patient and Organization resources. See the Table of Contents for more information.

#### Background
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/Background.html](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/Background.html)
Add a reference to updating the IG to include SHLs at the end of Introduction 2.1:
While STU 1.0.0 focused on a FHIR API -based exchange of digital insurance cards, in 2023, the need was identified to create portable, verifiable versions of digital insurance cards. In STU 1.1.0, the IG was expanded to include support for SMART Health Links.

#### Use Cases
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/Use_Case.html#use-cases](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/Use_Case.html#use-cases)
Add a new sub-use-case for SHLs as a means for consumer access and exchange:
The Digital Insurance Card can also be made available to the member in a verifiable, tamper-proof package that the subscriber can store, manage, and share with healthcare providers as they see fit. In this model, the payer provides the member with a QR code or URL representing their digital insurance card, likely using the same modalities used to share digital cards today (e.g. payer mobile application, website, email). The member is able to present the QR code to be scanned during in-person visits or provide the QR code or URL to mobile or web forms during online registration or check-in flows. The provider then uses the QR code or URL to retrieve the Digital Insurance Card and verify its authenticity.
SMART Health Cards are a FHIR-based verifiable credential technical framework that has been made available to hundreds of millions of people around the world for proof of vaccination and infectious disease laboratory testing results.
SMART Health Links are a derivation of SMART Health Cards that enable larger and dynamic data payloads as well as other methods of interaction.


_Flow:_
Payer shares the insurance card with a member (e.g., as a QR code and text-based link, via the payer website, mobile application, secure messaging, etc)
Member downloads/retrieves the QR code and/or link.
Member stores the QR code and link as they see fit, with options ranging from printing on paper to storing in health apps or wallets capable of interpreting SMART Health Links.
Member presents the SMART Health Link to healthcare provider
In-person:
Member presents the QR code on their device or paper
Check-in staff or kiosk scan the QR code
Online:
Member provides the insurance card to the online check-in app or web flow by pasting the link into a field, uploading a image of the QR, or in the future via API-based methods tailored to wallet and health apps
Healthcare provider processes the SMART Health Link and retrieves the insurance card information from the Payor (or designated data hosting service), verifying cryptographic signatures if desired
Healthcare provider, EHR vendor, or other platform vendor incorporates insurance information into existing workflows

#### Guidance

[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/General_Guidance.html](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-digital-insurance-card/General_Guidance.html)

<a name="actors"></a>
### Actors

The following actors are part of the CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Card:

* CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Requestor or Consumer App: An application that initiates a data access request to retrieve patient data. This can be thought of as the client in a client-server interaction.
* CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Responder or Health Plan API: A product that responds to the data access request providing patient data. This can be thought of as the server in a client-server interaction.

<a name="conformance-verbs"></a>
### Conformance Verbs

<p>The conformance verbs - <strong>SHALL, SHOULD, MAY</strong> - used in this guide are defined in <a style="font-size: 14px;" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html">FHIR Conformance Rules.</a></p>

<a name="must-support"></a>
### Must Support

<p>For profiles defined in other IGs, the meaning of Must Support is established in the defining IG. Note that the Must Support requirements for this IG are modeled after the US Core implementation guide. The requirements for Health Plan API actors are modeled on those for US Core Responders, and the requirements for Consumer App actors is modeled on those for US Core Requestors. When querying and reading CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Card Profiles, Must Support on any profile data element SHALL be interpreted as follows:</p>

<li>Health Plan API actors <strong>SHALL</strong>&nbsp;be capable of populating all data elements as part of the query results as specified by the CARIN for Digital Insurance Card CapabilityStatement.</li>
<li>Consumer App actors <strong>SHALL</strong> be capable of processing resource instances containing the data elements without generating an error or causing the application to fail.</li>
<li>Consumer App actors <strong>SHALL</strong> be capable of displaying the data elements for human use.</li>
<li>In situations where information on a particular data element is not present and the reason for absence is unknown, Health Plan API actors SHALL NOT include the data elements in the resource instance returned as part of the query results.</li>
<li>In situations where information on a particular data element is missing and the Health Plan API actor knows the precise reason for the absence of data, Health Plan API actors SHALL send the reason for the missing information using either the nullFlavors or dataAbsentReason extensions.</li>
<li>When querying Health Plan APIs, Consumer App actors SHALL interpret missing data elements within resource instances as data not present in the Health Plan API actor's system. Consumer App actors SHALL be able to process resource instances with missing data without generating an error or causing the application to fail for the user. Consumer App actors SHOULD configure their applications to translate nullFalvors and dataAbsentReason extensions into a user-friendly message indicating the data has not been provided by the Health Plan API actor.</li>

<p>NOTE: Readers are advised to understand <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html">FHIR Terminology</a> requirements, <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html">FHIR RESTful API</a> based on the HTTP protocol, along with <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html">FHIR Data Types</a>, <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html">FHIR Search</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource.html">FHIR Resource</a> formats before implementing CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Card requirements.</p>
  
<a name="missing-data"></a>
  
### Missing Data

<p>If the source system does not have data for a Must Support data element with minimum cardinality = 0, the data element is omitted from the resource. If the source system does not have data for a required data element (in other words, where the minimum cardinality is &gt; 0), follow guidance defined in the core FHIR specification and summarized in the&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data">US Core.</a></p>

<a name="conformance-to-us-core-profiles"></a>

### Conformance to US Core Profiles

<p>Any Health Plan API actor in this IG SHALL:</p>
  
* Be able to populate all profile data elements that have a minimum cardinality >= 1 and/or flagged as *Must Support* as defined by that profiles StructureDefinition.
* Conform to the US Core Server Capability Statement expectations for that profile's type.

<p>Any Consumer App actor in this IG SHALL:</p>
* Be able to process and retain all profile data elements that have a minimum cardinality >= 1 and/or flagged as Must Support as defined by that profiles StructureDefinition.
* Conform to the US Core Client Capability Statement expectations for that profiles type.

<a name="common-clinical-data-set"></a>

### U.S. Core Data for Interoperability and 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set

<p>The US Core Profiles were originally designed to meet the 2015 Edition certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7), and Application Access - Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each item in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/ccds_reference_document_v1_1.pdf">2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS).&nbsp;</a>The 3.1.0 version of the US Core Profiles IG includes new requirements from the latest proposed ONC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/notice-proposed-rulemaking-improve-interoperability-health">U.S. Core Data for Interoperability(USCDI)&nbsp;</a>.</p>

### The CARIN Alliance
The CARIN (Creating Access to Real-time Information Now through Consumer-Directed Exchange) Alliance is an [HL7 FHIR Accelerator program](http://www.hl7.org/about/fhir-accelerator/index.cfm) which brings implementers together to advance the use of HL7 FHIR standards in health care. The [CARIN Alliance Health Plan Workgroup](https://www.carinalliance.com/our-work/health-plan/) was organized to develop a FHIR-based API that could be implemented by a consumer-facing application. The goal of the CARIN Alliance Health Plan Workgroup is to develop an agreed upon set of data fields to exchange with consumers and a FHIR-based implementation guide for health plans and consumer facing applications to use to implement the API.

### Physical Insurance Card Data Elements
<p>This table outlines the necessary data elements found on physical insurance cards. This list of data elements was compiled through collaboration with numerous subject-matter experts across major insurance companies in the US. The authors of this IG also consulted the following resources for additional guidance:</p>

*	WEDI Health Identification Card Implementation Guide
*	WEDI Virtual Clipboard
*	NYS DFS Title 11, section 52.69
*	CAA/No Surprises Act, section 107 
*	SMART Health Card IG (related to QR codes)

### Use Case - Consumer Access to their Insurance Card Data
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This implementation guide is designed to standardize the way that health insurance companies provide the data elements found on the physical insurance card in a FHIR-based API exchange. The primary use case is to support insurance members (or their personal representatives) who wish to retrieve their current proof of insurance coverage digitally via a consumer-facing application. This will provide an alternative to using the physical insurance card as proof of insurance. </p>
<h5>Scenario</h5>
<p>When an individual visits a healthcare provider, they may be asked to provide proof of insurance prior to receiving care. Instead of relying on their physical insurance card, the individual may pull out their phone and open a digital application to display their insurance card information. This will assist in cases of a lost or forgotten physical insurance card. The provider can capture the necessary information for proof of insurance based on the information displayed in the consumer-facing application. </p>
<h4>Consumer-Directed Exchange</h4>
<p>Consumer-directed exchange occurs when a consumer or an authorized caregiver invokes their HIPAA Individual Right of Access (45 CFR 164.524) and requests their digital health information from a HIPAA covered entity (CE) via an application or other third-party data steward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="width: 85%; float: none; align: middle;" src="UseCaseDiagram.jpg"/></p>
<h4>Technical Workflow</h4>
<p>Precondition: Consumer App registers with a payer endpoint and receives a client ID and client secret<p>
<p><img style="width: 100%; float: none; align: middle;" src="CARINSequence.png" /> <b>Actors:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer (aka Subscriber, Member, Dependent, Patient, or Personal Representative)</li>
<li>Consumer App (aka digital third-party application selected by and primarily for the Consumer with a consumer-facing user interface)</li>
<li>Health Plan API (aka Payer, Covered Entity)</li>
<li>Health Plan&rsquo;s Identity and Access Authorization server</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Flow:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Consumer App presents a list of potential Payers / Health Plans that can be accessed by the Consumer.</li>
<li>Consumer selects the Payer / Health Plan to initiate the login and consent flow.</li>
<li>Consumer App redirects to the Health Planâ€™s Identity and Access Authorization server. Please note: The Health Plan may leverage a Third Party authentication service or technology for user login.</li>
<li>Consumer enters the credentials and consents to data sharing.</li>
<li>Health Plan's Identity and Access Authorization server validates the credentials, generates and returns to the Consumer App an OIDC token with authorized Consumer identities encoded.</li>
<li>Consumer App successfully links the user to the Payer / Health Plan and notifies the Consumer.</li>
<li>Consumer App requests the Coverage resource and associated resources as desired (i.e. Organization and/or Patient) along with the token and PatientID from step #5.</li>
<li>Health Planâ€™s Authorization server validates the access token.</li>
<li>Health Plan's FHIR API responds to the Consumer App with a bundle of the requested FHIR resources.</li>
<li>Consumer App receives the FHIR data and presents the information to the consumer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use Case - Consumer Access and Exchange</h3>

<p>The Digital Insurance Card can also be made available to the member in a verifiable, tamper-proof package that the subscriber can store, manage, and share with healthcare providers as they see fit. In this model, the payer provides the member with a QR code or URL representing their digital insurance card, likely using the same modalities used to share digital cards today (e.g. payer mobile application, website, email). The member is able to present the QR code to be scanned during in-person visits or provide the QR code or URL to mobile or web forms during online registration or check-in flows. The provider then uses the QR code or URL to retrieve the Digital Insurance Card and verify its authenticity.</p>

<p>[SMART Health Cards](https://spec.smarthealth.cards/) are a FHIR-based verifiable credential technical framework that has been made available to hundreds of millions of people around the world for proof of vaccination and infectious disease laboratory testing results.</p>

<p>[SMART Health Links](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/smart-health-links/design) are a derivation of SMART Health Cards that enable larger and dynamic data payloads as well as other methods of interaction.</p>

<p><b>Flow:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Payer shares the insurance card with a member (e.g., as a QR code and text-based link, via the payer website, mobile application, secure messaging, etc.).</li>
<li>Member downloads/retrieves the QR code and/or link.</li>
<li>Member stores the QR code and link as they see fit, with options ranging from printing on paper to storing in health apps or wallets capable of interpreting SMART Health Links.</li>
<li>Member presents the SMART Health Link to healthcare provider.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>In-person:</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>Member presents the QR code on their device or paper.</li>
<li>Check-in staff or kiosk scan the QR code.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Online:</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>Member provides the insurance card to the online check-in app or web flow by pasting the link into a field, uploading a image of the QR, or in the future via API-based methods tailored to wallet and health apps.</li>
<li>Healthcare provider processes the SMART Health Link and retrieves the insurance card information from the Payor (or designated data hosting service), verifying cryptographic signatures if desired.</li>
<li>Healthcare provider, EHR vendor, or other platform vendor incorporates insurance information into existing workflows.</li>
</ol>
