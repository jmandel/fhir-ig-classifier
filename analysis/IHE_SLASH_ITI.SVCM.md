# ITI.SVCM: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    The ITI.SVCM IG aims to provide a lightweight, standardized way for healthcare systems to access and share terminologies (like codes, value sets, and mappings) from a central location. It defines how systems can retrieve and use consistent, uniform sets of medical terms and mappings, simplifying data sharing and interoperability. This is intended for use in scenarios where systems need to access and utilize terminology resources, such as when ordering medications or updating patient records.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG combines the functionalities of the IHE ITI Sharing Value Sets (SVS) and IHE Patient Care Coordination Concept Mapping (CMAP) Profiles, simplifying them into a lighter-weight, mobile-compatible format using HTTP, JSON/XML, and REST. It provides an alternative to HL7 CTS and CTS2 with FHIR, creating an easily referenced source for profiles to use the Terminology Repository. It also supports automated loading of value sets by consumers, reducing manual configuration.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include: the use of FHIR R4 resources (CodeSystem, ValueSet, and ConceptMap); RESTful interactions using HTTP; support for JSON and XML formats; defined transactions for querying, expanding, looking up, validating, and translating terminology resources; and use of CapabilityStatements to describe actor capabilities. It specifies search parameters for finding terminology resources and defines specific operations (e.g., $expand, $lookup, $validate-code, $translate). It also introduces actors: Terminology Consumer and Terminology Repository. It also provides profiles for AuditEvents.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG is based on the HL7 FHIR standard, specifically using the CodeSystem, ValueSet, and ConceptMap resources. It also references DICOM and IHE standards for security and actor roles. It leverages existing terminologies like LOINC and SNOMED CT. It recommends ATNA for auditing and security.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    Primary users are healthcare IT systems and developers needing to access and utilize consistent medical terminologies. This includes electronic medical record (EMR) systems, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, and other applications that require structured medical data. By enabling interoperability and consistent use of terminologies, this IG indirectly benefits patients by improving the accuracy and consistency of their medical records and care.
