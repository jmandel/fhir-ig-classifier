It leverages the MedMorph Reference Architecture, FHIR Subscriptions, and SMART on FHIR to streamline data exchange between healthcare facilities and public health agencies. The IG heavily relies on clinical data retrieval and utilizes workflow automation for report generation and submission. While it touches upon identity and security through SMART on FHIR, its primary driver is public health surveillance.",
