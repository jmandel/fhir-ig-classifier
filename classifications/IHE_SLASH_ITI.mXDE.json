It heavily relies on FHIR for data representation and Provenance, and leverages existing IHE profiles built on HL7 v2 and v3 concepts for document sharing and querying. While it acknowledges CDA as a potential source document format, it doesn't directly define CDA-specific mappings or transformations. Cross-paradigm integration is evident in its use of FHIR with IHE profiles that have roots in v2 and v3.",

This facilitates clinical decision support, improves data usability, and bridges the gap between document-level and data element-level access.
