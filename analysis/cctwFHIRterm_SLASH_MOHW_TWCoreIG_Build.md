# MOHW_TWCoreIG_Build: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

- **Primary interoperability challenges this IG addresses:** This IG primarily addresses the challenge of standardizing health data exchange within Taiwan's healthcare system using HL7 FHIR R4. It aims to improve interoperability between different healthcare information systems by providing a common set of profiles, extensions, terminologies, and interaction patterns.
- **Key clinical/business problems it solves:** The IG solves problems related to inconsistent data formats, lack of standardized terminologies, and difficulties in sharing patient information across different healthcare providers and institutions. It facilitates the exchange of essential patient data, including demographics, allergies, medications, lab results, immunizations, and care plans, leading to improved care coordination, reduced medical errors, and enhanced patient safety. It also supports public health reporting and clinical research by enabling data aggregation and analysis.
- **Intended scope and boundaries:** The scope of this IG is focused on defining the core set of FHIR resources and profiles necessary for health information exchange within Taiwan. It establishes a foundation for further specialization and development of more specific use-case-driven IGs. The IG does not cover all possible FHIR resources or use cases but focuses on the most critical and commonly exchanged data elements. It is intended to be used by healthcare providers, health information system vendors, and government agencies within Taiwan.

## Technical Foundation

- **Core profiles and extensions:** The IG defines numerous profiles based on FHIR R4 resources, including Patient, Observation, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, Condition, AllergyIntolerance, Immunization, Procedure, DiagnosticReport, Encounter, CarePlan, CareTeam, Bundle, and others. Key extensions include identifier-suffix, person-age, TW postal code, and various address components specific to Taiwan.
- **Notable operations and interactions:** The IG emphasizes RESTful interactions, particularly search operations. It defines required and recommended search parameters for each profile, enabling efficient data retrieval. The Patient $everything operation is also defined.
- **Key terminology and value sets:** The IG leverages international standard terminologies such as LOINC, SNOMED CT, and RxNorm, alongside Taiwan-specific code systems and value sets, including Taiwan's ICD-10-CM/PCS, National Health Insurance (NHI) codes, and various government agency codes.
- **Significant patterns and constraints:** The IG establishes constraints on cardinality, data types, and terminology bindings for various data elements within each profile. It defines specific patterns for representing addresses, identifiers, and coding schemes. It also specifies maturity levels (FMM) for each profile, indicating their stability and readiness for implementation.

## Technical Essence

The MOHW_TWCoreIG_Build defines a comprehensive framework for FHIR R4-based interoperability in Taiwan's healthcare ecosystem. It establishes core profiles for essential resources like Patient, Observation (with specialized profiles for vital signs, lab results, etc.), MedicationRequest, Condition, and others, each with Taiwan-specific extensions like `identifier-suffix` and detailed address components (e.g., `tw-village`, `tw-alley`).  Data exchange is primarily driven by RESTful interactions, with a strong emphasis on search capabilities. Each profile mandates specific search parameters (e.g., `Patient?name`, `Observation?patient&category&code&date`). Terminology binding is crucial, leveraging international standards like LOINC and SNOMED CT alongside Taiwan-specific code systems (e.g., `icd-10-cm-2023-tw`, `medical-service-payment-tw`).  The IG enforces constraints on resource elements, such as requiring either `name.text` or `name.family` in Patient, and mandating specific value sets for elements like `Observation.category`.  The Bundle resource is profiled for document and message exchange.  Essentially, this IG provides a blueprint for a FHIR server implementation that can manage and exchange core patient data using standardized profiles, extensions, terminologies, and RESTful interactions tailored to the Taiwan healthcare context.

## Implementation Approach

- **Critical workflows and interactions:** The IG supports key workflows such as patient registration, searching for patients, retrieving patient demographics, accessing clinical data (allergies, conditions, medications, lab results, immunizations), managing care plans, and exchanging documents. RESTful interactions, particularly search operations, are central to these workflows.
- **Important requirements and guardrails:** Implementers must adhere to the defined profiles, extensions, and terminology bindings. They must support the required search parameters for each profile. The IG emphasizes the use of HTTPS for secure communication and recommends implementing audit logging and SMART on FHIR for authorization.
- **Notable design choices and patterns:** The IG adopts a modular approach, defining profiles for individual resources and using extensions to add Taiwan-specific elements. It leverages international standards where possible and defines local code systems and value sets when necessary. The use of Bundle for document and message exchange is a notable pattern.

## Ecosystem Context

- **Target systems and users:** The primary target systems are electronic health record (EHR) systems, laboratory information systems (LIS), pharmacy systems, and other health information systems used by healthcare providers in Taiwan. The target users include clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, and other healthcare professionals, as well as health IT developers and system administrators.
- **Relationship to other standards/IGs:** The IG is based on FHIR R4 and references international standards such as LOINC, SNOMED CT, and RxNorm. It builds upon and extends the FHIR standard to meet the specific needs of Taiwan's healthcare system. It also references the International Patient Summary (IPS) and US Core Implementation Guide.
- **Relevant jurisdictions or programs:** The IG is developed and maintained by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) of Taiwan and is intended for use within Taiwan's national healthcare system. It is relevant to programs such as the National Health Insurance (NHI) and the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) exchange program.
- **Primary use cases and scenarios:** The IG supports a wide range of use cases, including sharing patient demographics, exchanging clinical documents, querying for patient data, managing medication lists, accessing lab results, and supporting public health reporting. It enables scenarios such as a doctor accessing a patient's medical history from a different hospital, a pharmacist verifying a prescription, or a public health agency collecting immunization data.
