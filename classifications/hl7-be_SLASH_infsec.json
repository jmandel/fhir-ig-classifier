While it mentions other standards like HL7 v3, SNOMED CT, and LOINC through aliases, it doesn't deeply integrate them, suggesting a minimal level of cross-paradigm support.",

Its core purpose is to enable secure data sharing while adhering to privacy regulations like GDPR. While it touches upon administrative aspects through its focus on the Belgian eHealth platform, its main emphasis is on identity and security, specifically data anonymization. It also has implications for clinical data integrity and potentially research, but these are secondary to its primary focus on secure pseudonymization.",
