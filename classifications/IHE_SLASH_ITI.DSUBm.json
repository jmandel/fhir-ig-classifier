  "rationale": "The ITI.DSUBm Implementation Guide defines a profile for document subscription and notification mechanisms tailored for RESTful applications, particularly in mobile environments. It leverages FHIR R4 and builds upon the HL7 Subscriptions R5 Backport Implementation Guide. The core functionality revolves around defining how subscriptions are created, managed, and triggered based on specific events related to document sharing resources like DocumentReference, Folder, and SubmissionSet. \n\nDSUBm defines several key artifacts:\n\n1.  **Subscription Topics:** These are represented as `Basic` resources and define the types of events that can be subscribed to. Examples include Patient-Dependent DocumentReference SubscriptionTopic, Multi-Patient DocumentReference SubscriptionTopic, and various Folder SubscriptionTopics.\n2.  **Subscription Resources:** These resources, based on the FHIR `Subscription` resource, specify the criteria for triggering notifications. They include details like the subscription topic, filter criteria, channel type (rest-hook), endpoint URL, and payload content.\n3.  **Transactions:** DSUBm defines five transactions:\n    *   **Resource Subscription [ITI-110]:** Used to create, update (unsubscribe/re-activate), and manage subscriptions.\n    *   **Resource Publish [ITI-111]:** Used by a publisher to notify the broker about events that might match subscriptions.\n    *   **Resource Notify [ITI-112]:** Used by the broker to send notifications to subscribers.\n    *   **Resource Subscription Search [ITI-113]:** Used to search for existing subscriptions.\n    *   **Resource SubscriptionTopic Search [ITI-114]:** Used to search for available subscription topics.\n4.  **Notifications:** DSUBm defines different types of notifications, including Handshake, Heartbeat, Event, and Subscription Deactivation notifications.\n5.  **Security Considerations:** The guide emphasizes the importance of security, recommending the use of ATNA for auditing and suggesting the use of IUA or SMART for user authentication and authorization.\n\nIn essence, DSUBm provides a framework for mobile applications to subscribe to specific document-related events within a healthcare environment and receive notifications when those events occur. It focuses on defining the structure and exchange mechanisms for these subscriptions and notifications, leveraging FHIR resources and RESTful interactions.",
