Pharmacy and Lab systems have limited but defined roles in verifying provider and organization information. Research platforms might use it for identifying potential research sites and collaborators. PHR systems could leverage it for provider search and selection. Clinical Decision Support systems have minimal direct interaction, while Imaging Systems are not involved.",
