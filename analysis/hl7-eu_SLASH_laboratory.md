# laboratory: Analysis

1. **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
This IG aims to define a European standard for representing laboratory reports using HL7 FHIR. It's designed to facilitate harmonization among national initiatives and support the development of the European EHR exchange format (E-EHRxF). The context is the cross-border exchange of health data within the European Union, particularly for laboratory reports, as well as national implementation. It is intended for use by implementers, system developers, and healthcare organizations involved in creating, exchanging, or consuming laboratory data.

2. **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
This IG improves upon previous approaches by moving away from HL7 CDA-based solutions to HL7 FHIR, and by providing specific guidance for laboratory reports using FHIR, addressing the shortcomings of previous approaches by balancing the need for a legally signable document with the REST paradigm. It also aims to provide a framework for a coherent ecosystem of laboratory report IGs and promotes the pre-adoption of R5 rules for document bundles.

3. **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
Key features include:
    *   Use of the DiagnosticReport resource as the primary representation of a laboratory report, linked to a Composition resource to define the report's structure and document context.
    *   Pre-adoption of R5 rules for document bundles, allowing for more flexibility in resource inclusion.
    *   Definition of specific profiles for key resources such as Observation, Specimen, and Patient to align with laboratory requirements.
    *   Use of terminologies such as LOINC, SNOMED CT, and UCUM for consistent coding of laboratory data.
    *   Specification of obligations for different actors (creator, repository, consumer) to ensure consistent data handling.
    *   Definition of mappings between eHN data sets and FHIR resources through ConceptMaps.
    *   A layered approach to specification, allowing for global, regional and national standards to be built on this base.
    *   Support for both human and non-human specimens and subjects, as well as complex test panels using Observation groupings.
    *   Inclusion of specific extensions for handling complex names, birth places, or specimen details.
    *   Use of a combination of profiles and logical models to define the laboratory report components.

4. **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
This IG is designed to align with the European eHealth Network (eHN) guidelines for cross-border exchange of health data, the proposed European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation, and promotes the use of international standards such as HL7 FHIR, LOINC, SNOMED CT, and UCUM. It also takes into account the requirements for traceability of laboratory measurements, aligning with ISO standards for reference materials.

5. **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
Primary users include:
    *   Implementers and developers of laboratory information systems (LIS) and electronic health record (EHR) systems in Europe.
    *   Healthcare organizations and laboratories involved in cross-border data exchange.
    *   European national bodies responsible for eHealth initiatives.
    *   Researchers and data analysts working with standardized laboratory data.

While patients are not direct users, they are indirect beneficiaries. The use of this guide will eventually improve the interoperability of laboratory data, resulting in better quality of care and safer healthcare processes.
