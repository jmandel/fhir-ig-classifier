# vr-common-library: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The Vital Records Common Library (VRCL) FHIR IG aims to standardize the exchange of vital records information (births, fetal deaths, and deaths) using FHIR. It acts as a central repository for shared data elements, profiles, extensions, and terminologies used across multiple vital records-related FHIR IGs, including:

* **Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR)**
* **Birth Defects Reporting (BDR)**
* **Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR)**
* **Medicolegal and Death Investigation (MDI)**

By providing a common set of resources, VRCL seeks to:

* **Reduce redundancy:** Eliminate duplicate definitions of common data elements across IGs.
* **Promote interoperability:** Enable seamless data exchange between systems involved in vital records processing.
* **Simplify implementation:** Ease the burden on developers and providers by offering pre-defined, standardized resources.

VRCL itself does not define specific use cases or workflows. Instead, it focuses on establishing a consistent foundation for vital records data exchange that other IGs can build upon.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

Based on the provided files, VRCL STU2 introduces several improvements over its previous version (STU1.1) and earlier practices:

* **Harmonization:** VRCL STU2 consolidates and standardizes resources previously scattered across multiple IGs, reducing redundancy and inconsistency.
* **Alignment with VRDR:** It adopts successful patterns from the mature VRDR IG, such as defining codesystems and valuesets directly within the IG and using "edit flags" within profiles.
* **Enhanced data capture:** It introduces profiles and extensions for capturing detailed race and ethnicity information, including both input and coded data.
* **Generalized profiles:** Abstract profiles like `PatientVitalRecords` provide a flexible basis for deriving specific patient profiles used in various vital records contexts.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

* **Abstract profiles:** VRCL defines abstract profiles (e.g., `PatientVitalRecords`, `LocationVitalRecords`) that serve as templates for creating concrete profiles tailored to specific vital records use cases.
* **Extensions:** It utilizes extensions to represent data elements not directly supported by core FHIR resources, such as partial dates (`ExtensionPartialDateVitalRecords`, `ExtensionPartialDateTimeVitalRecords`), coded address components (`ExtensionCityCodeVitalRecords`, `ExtensionDistrictCodeVitalRecords`), and fetal death status (`ExtensionPatientFetalDeathVitalRecords`).
* **Codesystems and valuesets:** VRCL includes its own codesystems and valuesets for vital records-specific concepts, eliminating reliance on external terminologies like PHIN VADS.
* **Edit flags:** It incorporates "edit flags" within profiles (e.g., `ObservationEducationLevelVitalRecords`, `PatientChildVitalRecords`) to indicate data validation outcomes and support data quality processes.

## 4. Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations

VRCL aligns with broader healthcare standards and regulations by:

* **Adhering to FHIR:** It leverages the FHIR standard for data representation and exchange.
* **Using standard terminologies:** It utilizes established terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and HL7 codesystems where applicable.
* **Supporting US Core profiles:** It extends US Core profiles for resources like Patient, Practitioner, and Location, ensuring compatibility with US-centric data exchange requirements.

While the provided files do not explicitly mention specific regulations, VRCL's focus on vital records data suggests relevance to regulations governing birth, death, and fetal death reporting, such as those issued by NCHS and state/jurisdictional vital records agencies.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

The primary users and beneficiaries of VRCL include:

* **Developers:** Implementers of vital records systems who can leverage VRCL's resources to build interoperable solutions.
* **Public health agencies:** Organizations responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing vital records data.
* **Healthcare providers:** Individuals involved in documenting and reporting vital events, such as physicians, midwives, and coroners.
* **Researchers:** Scientists and analysts who utilize vital records data for public health research and surveillance.

While patients are not direct users of VRCL, they ultimately benefit from its contribution to accurate and efficient vital records management, which underpins public health surveillance, policy development, and individual healthcare.
