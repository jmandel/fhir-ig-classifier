While it references HL7 standards, the primary focus is on IHE-defined codes and profiles. IHE is an international organization, but its profiles and frameworks are often adopted and adapted at national or regional levels. However, this IG is specifically focused on the IHE framework itself, making it most applicable to the \"Universal Realm\" as it is designed for use within the IHE ecosystem regardless of specific national or regional adaptations.",
