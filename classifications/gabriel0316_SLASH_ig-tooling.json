While it acknowledges v2 and v3 code systems, it doesn't directly integrate with v2 messaging or v3 models. CDA is not relevant as the IG focuses on FHIR resources, not CDA documents. Cross-paradigm integration is minimal, primarily acknowledging the existence of other standards through terminology usage.",
