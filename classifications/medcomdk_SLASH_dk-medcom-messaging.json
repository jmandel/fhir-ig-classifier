  "rationale": "The `dk-medcom-messaging` FHIR Implementation Guide defines a framework for message-based exchange within the Danish healthcare system. It establishes core messaging profiles, including `MedComMessagingMessage`, `MedComMessagingMessageHeader`, `MedComMessagingOrganization`, and `MedComMessagingProvenance`, which are intended to be used as a foundation for other, more specialized IGs like HospitalNotification and CareCommunication. \n\nThe IG specifies that all MedCom messages are FHIR bundles of type 'message', with a MessageHeader as the first resource. The MessageHeader includes sender, receiver, and optional carbon-copy receiver organizations, all of which must conform to the `MedComMessagingOrganization` profile. This profile mandates both SOR and EAN/GLN identifiers for addressing. The Provenance resource tracks message activity and history, referencing the current MessageHeader and any previous messages. \n\nThe IG also defines a `MedComMessagingMessageDefinition` profile, which is not included in message exchange but can be used to describe the characteristics of a message, such as the initiating event and expected responses. The `MedComMessagingMessageDefinitionFhir` profile further constrains this for FHIR messages. Additionally, the IG includes profiles for representing the producer (`MedComProducerOrganization`) and requester (`MedComRequesterOrganization`) of observations, which are relevant for specific use cases like laboratory and homecare observations. \n\nOverall, this IG focuses on defining the structure and core components of MedCom messages, providing a standardized approach to message exchange in the Danish healthcare context. It relies on FHIR R4 and has dependencies on the `MedComCore` and `DK-core` IGs. The IG is intended for use within Denmark and is governed by MedCom.",
