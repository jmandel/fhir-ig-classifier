# fhir-us-mcc: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the representation, query, and exchange of Care Plan information for patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). It focuses on the needs of patients with conditions like Chronic Kidney Disease, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, and Long COVID. The context is healthcare data interoperability, enabling systems to share and aggregate patient data for better care planning. It is for healthcare technology experts, programmers, business analysts and technology decision makers involved in creating and implementing these systems. It also attempts to provide value to patients and caregivers.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves upon previous approaches by defining specific FHIR R4 profiles, structures, extensions, transactions, and value sets tailored for MCC care planning. It reuses and constrains US Core profiles, adding constraints and extensions relevant to care planning, and emphasizing MUST support flags. It also leverages existing standard terminologies and provides guidance on how to use them for specific use cases. It attempts to provide a way to represent a dynamic care plan and test its ability to bring together aggregated patient care plan data including patient outcomes.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include the use of FHIR R4, reuse and constraint of US Core profiles, creation of new profiles where needed, and a focus on data elements identified by expert panels. It uses a value set library housed in VSAC and provides guidance on using these value sets. It also defines specific profiles for observations, conditions, goals, service requests, and procedures, emphasizing linkages between these profiles within a FHIR CarePlan. The IG provides guidance on how to aggregate the data required for the care plan. The IG uses FHIR batch and transaction operations to move an aggregated care plan from a sending system to a receiving system.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds upon the US Core Implementation Guide and adheres to US Core conformance requirements, including Must Support and Provenance. It reuses US Core profiles and aligns with USCDI data elements, particularly those related to Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The IG also references HL7 standards and uses value sets housed in the NLM VSAC.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users of this IG are healthcare technology experts, programmers, and business analysts involved in creating and implementing standards-based FHIR APIs and systems for MCC care planning. The beneficiaries are patients with MCC and their caregivers, who are expected to benefit from improved care coordination, patient-centered care planning, and better communication among their care teams. The IG also aims to support uses of patient data beyond direct care, such as public health, population health, quality measurement, and research.
