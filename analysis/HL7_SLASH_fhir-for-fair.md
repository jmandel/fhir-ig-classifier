# fhir-for-fair: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to guide the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles using HL7 FHIR resources, especially for health data. It focuses on making health data more usable and reusable for both humans and machines. The context is the increasing need for better data management in research and healthcare, where data is often underutilized or difficult to share and reuse. The guide is for researchers, health data providers, technical implementers, government agencies, and the public.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG provides specific guidance on how to use HL7 FHIR to implement FAIR principles, particularly in cases where data is not natively FAIR or FHIR. It addresses the need for distinct, identifiable metadata and data objects, and it provides a structured approach for assessing and improving FAIRness using the RDA indicators. It emphasizes the importance of unique and persistent identifiers, rich metadata, standardized protocols, and clear licensing, all within the context of HL7 FHIR. It also highlights the use of FHIR's capabilities to improve interoperability and reusability, leveraging the standard's existing structures for representing clinical data and metadata.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features of this IG include:
    *   **Use of HL7 FHIR:** It leverages FHIR resources like Library, ResearchStudy, List, DocumentManifest, and Citation to represent metadata at both study and subject levels.
    *   **FAIR Principle Implementation:** It provides guidance on how to implement each of the FAIR principles using FHIR, including assigning persistent identifiers, using rich metadata, standard communication protocols, and clear licensing.
    *   **RDA Indicator Assessment:** It uses the RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model indicators to assess and improve FAIRness, which helps to measure the level of FAIRness of the data.
    *   **Extensibility:** It defines extensions for resources to capture copyright, licensing, related content, and other subject information.
    *   **Conformance Resources:** It includes FHIR profiles and value sets to ensure consistency and interoperability.
    *   **Practical Examples:** It provides real-world case examples, showing how the recommendations can be applied in practice.
    *   **Focus on Metadata:** The guide focuses on the critical role of metadata in making data FAIR, highlighting the need for distinct and identifiable metadata objects, and guidance on how to represent them.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG builds upon the HL7 FHIR standard, a widely recognized standard for health data interoperability. It addresses the increasing need to make health data more FAIR, which aligns with broader goals of data sharing and reusability for research and healthcare. It helps to bridge the gap between regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, and the technical implementation of FAIR principles, by suggesting how to implement them using a standard such as HL7 FHIR. It also provides specific guidance on how to represent licensing and provenance information, which are relevant to data governance and compliance.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users and beneficiaries include:
    *   **Researchers:** Who can more easily find, access, and reuse health data for their research, enhancing reproducibility and collaboration.
    *   **Health Data Providers:** Who can better manage and share their data in a FAIR manner, improving data quality and accessibility.
    *   **Technical Implementers:** Who can use the guide to build FAIR data systems using HL7 FHIR, ensuring interoperability and reusability.
    *   **Government Agencies:** Who can develop policies and regulations that support FAIR data principles, promoting transparency and accountability.
    *   **The Public:** Who can benefit from improved healthcare outcomes and a more transparent research process. Although not directly addressed, patients are indirect beneficiaries as better data will result in better research and better healthcare.
