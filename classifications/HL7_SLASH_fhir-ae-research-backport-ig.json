    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on standardizing Adverse Event (AE) data in clinical research, with a strong emphasis on meeting regulatory needs, particularly mentioning the FDA. While it leverages international standards like HL7 FHIR and mentions international guidelines like ICH E2A, the explicit mention of the FDA and its relevance to jurisdictions requiring AE reporting in clinical research suggests a strong alignment with the United States. However, it does not explicitly state that it is governed by the US, and the guide is designed to be broadly applicable to clinical research globally. Therefore, it is scored as strongly aligned with the US but not exclusively designed for it.",
