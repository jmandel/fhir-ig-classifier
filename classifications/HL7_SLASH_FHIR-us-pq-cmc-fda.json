    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on standardizing the submission of Pharmaceutical Quality/Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (PQ/CMC) data to the US FDA, primarily for solid oral dosage forms. It leverages FHIR R5 to create a structured, machine-readable format for data exchange, replacing the traditional document-centric approach. The IG's core purpose is to streamline the drug approval process by improving data quality, consistency, and efficiency. While it touches upon medications and administrative aspects related to drug product applications, its primary focus is on the detailed technical specifications of drug substances, manufacturing processes, and quality control.",
