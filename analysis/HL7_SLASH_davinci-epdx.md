## 1. Objectives and Context

The Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) Implementation Guide aims to standardize the exchange of patient data between payers (health plans) and other healthcare entities, such as providers and other payers.  It focuses on enabling secure and efficient data sharing for various use cases, including:

* **Payer-to-Payer Data Exchange:** Facilitating the transfer of patient information when a member switches health plans, ensuring continuity of care.
* **Provider Access API:** Allowing in-network providers to access their patients' clinical data held by payers to enhance care coordination.
* **Prior Authorization:** Streamlining the prior authorization process for medical procedures by enabling electronic exchange of prior authorization requests and decisions.

The IG is designed for payers, providers, EHR vendors, and other healthcare stakeholders involved in exchanging patient data.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The IG builds upon existing standards like US Core and leverages FHIR R4 capabilities, improving upon previous approaches by:

* **Standardizing Data Exchange:** Defining specific FHIR profiles and operations for consistent and interoperable data exchange.
* **Enhancing Security:** Incorporating OAuth 2.0, SMART on FHIR, and mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure data access and transmission.
* **Supporting Bulk Data Exchange:** Enabling efficient retrieval of large datasets through asynchronous bulk data operations.
* **Addressing Consent and Privacy:** Incorporating consent management and data tagging for sensitive information to ensure patient privacy.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

* **FHIR Profiles:** Defines profiles for key resources like Patient, Coverage, Encounter, Provenance, and ExplanationOfBenefit, extending US Core profiles with payer-specific elements.
* **Operations:** Specifies operations like $member-match and $bulk-member-match for member identification and bulk data retrieval.
* **CDS Hooks:** Leverages CDS Hooks for event-driven data exchange, such as notifying payers when a patient books an appointment.
* **SMART on FHIR:** Utilizes SMART on FHIR for app authorization and user context management.
* **Security:** Employs OAuth 2.0 for authorization, SMART on FHIR for app launch, and mTLS for secure communication.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

* **US Core:** Aligns with and extends the US Core Implementation Guide for interoperability with US healthcare systems.
* **ONC Cures Act Final Rule:** Supports data sharing requirements outlined in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, promoting patient access and data exchange.
* **HIPAA:** Adheres to HIPAA regulations for protecting patient health information (PHI) through secure data exchange mechanisms.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

* **Payers:** Benefit from standardized data exchange for member transitions, prior authorization, and provider data sharing.
* **Providers:** Gain access to their patients' clinical data held by payers, improving care coordination and decision-making.
* **EHR Vendors:** Implement the IG to enable their systems to participate in PDex and support provider access to payer data.
* **Patients:** Ultimately benefit from improved continuity of care, more informed providers, and potentially enhanced privacy controls through consent management.
