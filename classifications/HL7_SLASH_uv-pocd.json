    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally based on FHIR for representing and exchanging point-of-care medical device data. It leverages concepts from IEEE 11073 but adapts them to the FHIR framework. While it acknowledges HL7 v2 through its relationship with IHE PCD, it doesn't directly utilize v2 or v3. CDA is not relevant to its core purpose. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges IEEE 11073 with FHIR, but not in the traditional HL7 sense of integrating v2, v3, and CDA.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on representing and exchanging data from acute care point-of-care medical devices (PoCDs). It leverages a hierarchical device model based on IEEE 11073 and defines profiles for devices, metrics, and observations. The primary goal is to enable richer data capture for clinical decision support, quality measurement, research, and device management. While it touches upon administrative aspects through device management, its core is clinical data from diagnostic devices, with a strong emphasis on accurate and detailed representation of measurements and their context.",

Clinical care teams benefit from richer data for decision support, while researchers gain access to detailed device data for analysis.  The IG also serves the needs of those responsible for device management and data quality, such as clinical engineers (captured under Healthcare Administrators).
