  "rationale": "The ca-baseline FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining a set of FHIR profiles, value sets, and code sets tailored for use within the Canadian healthcare context. It establishes a baseline for interoperability by specifying common data elements, structures, and terminologies that should be supported across various Canadian implementations. The guide emphasizes data modeling, outlining the minimum mandatory elements, extensions, and terminology requirements for each profile. It also addresses data exchange by referencing FHIR's conformance rules and providing guidance on handling data elements. While the guide touches upon security considerations, its primary focus is not on defining specific security mechanisms. The artifacts defined in this IG are intended to serve as a foundation for more specific jurisdictional or project-specific implementation guides. The guide's scope is national, aiming to improve consistency across the Canadian healthcare landscape. It targets a wide range of stakeholders, including technical implementers (like EHR vendors and system integrators), healthcare provider organizations, public health organizations, and standards organizations. The guide is based on FHIR R4 and includes profiles for various clinical and administrative resources, such as Patient, Practitioner, Organization, Condition, Observation, Medication, and others. It also defines extensions and value sets specific to the Canadian context, such as Canadian health card numbers and service languages. The guide's development process involved a grassroots community effort, with contributions from Canadian implementation guide authors, implementors, standards experts, and vendors. It underwent a due diligence review against existing Canadian FHIR implementations to ensure alignment and consistency.",
