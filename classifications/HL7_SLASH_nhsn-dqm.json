  "rationale": "The `nhsn-dqm` FHIR Implementation Guide defines specifications for reporting digital quality measures (dQMs) to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). It focuses on establishing a framework based on existing Quality Measure (QM) and Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) IGs, defining baseline profiles and value sets for NHSN. \n\nKey artifacts created by this IG include:\n\n1.  **Profiles:** It defines profiles for structuring FHIR resources like `NHSNMeasureBundle`, `NHSNMeasureReportBundle`, `NHSNSubmittingOrganization`, `NHSNSubmittingDevice`, and `PatientsOfInterestList`. These profiles specify how data should be organized and represented for submission.\n2.  **CapabilityStatements:** It defines `CapabilityStatement` resources for different actors in the NHSN ecosystem, such as `NHSNCapabilityStatementDataSource`, `NHSNCapabilityStatementEvaluationEngine`, `NHSNCapabilityStatementMeasureSource`, and `NHSNCapabilityStatementMeasureReportRecipient`. These statements outline the expected capabilities of systems playing these roles.\n3.  **CodeSystems:** It defines the `HealthareCapacityCodeSystem` for reporting healthcare capacity to NHSN.\n4.  **ValueSets:** It defines `ValueSet` resources like `AcuteCareHospitalEncounterStatus` and `AcuteCareHospitalEncounterClass` for standardizing terminology used in acute care hospital settings.\n5.  **Examples:** It provides numerous example FHIR resources demonstrating how to structure data according to the defined profiles, including examples for bundles, measure reports, patients, encounters, conditions, and other clinical data.\n6.  **Libraries:** It includes example libraries like `NHSNdQMAcuteCareHospitalInitialPopulationLibrary` demonstrating how to define initial populations for dQMs using Clinical Quality Language (CQL).\n\nThis IG does not define specific dQMs but provides the infrastructure for reporting them. It emphasizes leveraging existing EHR FHIR APIs and US Core profiles where possible. The focus is on enabling electronic submission of surveillance data to NHSN using FHIR, supporting CDC's Data Modernization Initiative.",
