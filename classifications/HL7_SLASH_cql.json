    "summary": "This IG defines the Clinical Quality Language (CQL), a domain-specific language for expressing clinical logic. While it mentions FHIR and its Clinical Reasoning Module, the core of the IG is the language specification itself, not FHIR resources or interactions. It acknowledges other HL7 standards like HQMF and the CDS Knowledge Artifact Specification but doesn't deeply integrate with them. It's designed to be data-model agnostic, making it independent of specific HL7 versions or CDA.",
