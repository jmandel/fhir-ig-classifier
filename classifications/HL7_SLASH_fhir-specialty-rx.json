  "rationale": "The fhir-specialty-rx Implementation Guide defines several FHIR profiles and workflows to facilitate the exchange of information related to specialty medications. The core functionality of this IG is to define the structure and content of messages and RESTful interactions that support the exchange of patient demographic, clinical, and coverage data between a prescriber's EHR system (Data Source) and a pharmacy or other party involved in fulfilling a specialty medication prescription (Data Consumer). \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines:\n\n1.  **Profiles for key resources:** The IG defines profiles for resources like Patient, Practitioner, Organization, MedicationRequest, Coverage, Task, and Consent. These profiles constrain the content of these resources to meet the specific needs of specialty medication workflows, often referencing US Core profiles for base elements and adding extensions or constraints relevant to specialty pharmacy. For example, the `specialty-rx-patient` profile builds upon the US Core Patient profile, while the `specialty-rx-coverage` profile adds elements like `rxbin`, `rxpcn`, and `rxgroup` to capture pharmacy benefit information.\n2.  **Messaging structures:** The IG defines several message types, including `specialty-rx-query`, `specialty-rx-query-response`, `specialty-rx-query-response-unsolicited`, and `specialty-rx-error`. These messages are used to request and return patient information, or to proactively push information from the prescriber to the pharmacy. The structure of these messages is defined using MessageDefinition and Bundle resources, specifying the required and optional parameters and resources within each message.\n3.  **Workflows:** The IG describes both solicited and unsolicited workflows for exchanging information. The solicited workflow involves a Data Consumer requesting information from a Data Source, while the unsolicited workflow involves the Data Source proactively pushing information to the Data Consumer. These workflows can be implemented using either RESTful interactions or FHIR messaging.\n4.  **Search conventions:** The IG provides guidance on how to construct FHIR searches to retrieve relevant patient data, including required and recommended search parameters. It also specifies how search results should be packaged and returned, including the use of `_include` and `_revinclude` parameters.\n5.  **Patient matching:** The IG outlines methods for matching patients between the Data Consumer and Data Source systems, including the use of the `Patient/$match` operation and the inclusion of patient identifiers in messages.\n6.  **Error handling:** The IG defines how errors should be handled and communicated, including the use of OperationOutcome resources to describe errors encountered during message processing or RESTful interactions.\n7.  **Consent workflows:** The IG defines workflows for requesting and sharing patient consents related to specialty medication fulfillment, including the use of Task resources to manage the consent process and Consent resources to represent the consent forms themselves.\n8.  **SMART App Launch:** The IG defines a workflow for launching SMART apps from within the EHR to facilitate human interaction and the collection of additional information not available through systematic queries.\n\nIn essence, the fhir-specialty-rx IG provides a comprehensive framework for exchanging information related to specialty medications, leveraging FHIR's capabilities for both RESTful interactions and messaging. It focuses on defining the structure and content of the exchanged data, as well as the workflows and processes for managing the exchange.",
