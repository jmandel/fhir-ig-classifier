    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on the FHIR standard, defining profiles and extensions for the Danish municipal health and social care sector. It leverages FHIR's RESTful approach and resource model as its core. While it acknowledges and uses external terminologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC, it doesn't directly integrate with HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. The IG does demonstrate cross-paradigm thinking by integrating FHIR with national frameworks like FSIII and FFB, but this is more about bridging FHIR with domain-specific models than with other HL7 standards.",
