It introduces a framework for defining, declaring, and querying specific FHIR implementation features, allowing applications to dynamically adapt to server capabilities. While it touches upon administrative aspects through the CapabilityStatement, its core purpose is to improve the technical interoperability of FHIR systems by providing a mechanism for fine-grained feature discovery and negotiation. Therefore, it primarily impacts the workflow and technical aspects of FHIR implementations.",
