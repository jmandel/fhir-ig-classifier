  "rationale": "The FHIRcast Implementation Guide primarily defines a mechanism for synchronizing healthcare applications in real time. It specifies a publish-subscribe model where applications (Subscribers) can subscribe to specific workflow-related events through a central Hub. The IG defines the format of these events, which are essentially JSON wrappers around FHIR resources, and outlines the process for subscribing, unsubscribing, and receiving event notifications. \n\nKey aspects defined by the IG include:\n\n1.  **Session Discovery:** How applications discover the Hub and the session topic.\n2.  **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Scopes:** Specific scopes for FHIRcast events, allowing granular access control.\n3.  **Event Format:** A standardized format for events, including mandatory fields like `hub.topic`, `hub.event`, and `context`.\n4.  **Subscription and Unsubscription:** The process for applications to subscribe to and unsubscribe from events, including request and response formats.\n5.  **Event Notification:** How the Hub notifies Subscribers about events, including the format of the notification and the expected response from Subscribers.\n6.  **Request Context Change:** How Subscribers can request changes to the context, which the Hub then broadcasts to other Subscribers.\n7.  **Conformance:** A `.well-known` endpoint for Hubs to expose their capabilities and a FHIR CapabilityStatement extension for declaring support for FHIRcast.\n8.  **Extensions:** A mechanism for extending the specification with custom behavior and information.\n9.  **Get Current Context:** An optional API for Subscribers to retrieve the current context of a session.\n10. **Content Sharing:** An optional mechanism for exchanging content between clients subscribed to the same topic using FHIRcast messages.\n11. **Event Library:** A catalog of predefined events, such as `Patient-open`, `Patient-close`, `Encounter-open`, `Encounter-close`, `ImagingStudy-open`, `ImagingStudy-close`, `DiagnosticReport-open`, `DiagnosticReport-close`, `DiagnosticReport-update`, and `DiagnosticReport-select`.\n\nIn essence, the FHIRcast IG establishes a framework for real-time synchronization of healthcare applications, focusing on the communication protocol and data formats involved in event-driven interactions. It leverages FHIR resources to represent the context being synchronized and defines a set of events that represent common workflow actions in healthcare settings.",
