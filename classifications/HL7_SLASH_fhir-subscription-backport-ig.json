It primarily addresses the workflow of real-time data exchange and event-driven notifications. While it touches upon administrative aspects through subscription management and mentions potential use cases in public health and clinical data exchange, its core purpose is to define the technical mechanism for subscriptions and notifications. Therefore, Workflow is the primary domain, with Clinical Data and Administrative domains playing supporting roles.",

It primarily impacts systems that need to send or receive real-time notifications based on specific events. EHR systems are central, as they often manage the data being subscribed to and initiate subscriptions. Systems that consume these notifications, such as Clinical Decision Support and Public Health Systems, also play a significant role. While the IG doesn't directly involve Payer or Pharmacy systems, they might indirectly benefit from improved data flow. Research Platforms could leverage subscriptions for data collection. PHR systems could use it for patient notifications, but the focus is more on system-to-system communication.",
