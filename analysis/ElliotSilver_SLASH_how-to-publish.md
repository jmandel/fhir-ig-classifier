# how-to-publish: Analysis

1. **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
   This IG aims to guide authors on how to properly publish a FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) to a website, making it accessible to a wider audience. It focuses on using the IG Publisher's `-go-publish` functionality, which addresses deficiencies in basic IG publication. The context is the challenge of making IGs discoverable and usable beyond local development or CI builds. It's for IG authors who want to make their IGs publicly available and properly registered with FHIR tooling.

2. **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
   This IG improves upon simply uploading IG output to a website or using the CI auto-build by:
   *   Modifying the page header to indicate a proper publication, including version and history links.
   *   Providing redirect configuration for canonical URLs to resolve correctly.
   *   Structuring the publication directory to support multiple IG releases.
   *   Preparing updates to publication feed files for registration with FHIR tooling.

3. **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
   Key features include:
   *   Detailed steps for using the IG Publisher's `-go-publish` functionality.
   *   Instructions for setting up a local publication environment.
   *   Guidance on configuring `publish-setup.json` to manage publication structure.
   *   Explanation of how to update the `ig-registry` to register the published IG.
   *   Use of `publication-request.json` to populate publication feeds.
   *   Emphasis on using the most current releases of IG tooling.
   *   Focus on proper canonical URL resolution and versioning.

4. **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG directly relates to the HL7 FHIR standard by providing guidance on how to publish FHIR Implementation Guides. It also references the FHIR license and the use of LOINC, SNOMED CT, and CPT terminologies, which are common in healthcare. The IG promotes the proper use of FHIR and its ecosystem tools, which are crucial for interoperability in healthcare settings.

5. **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users of this IG are FHIR IG authors and developers who need to publish their IGs to a website. These authors work within the healthcare ecosystem to create profiles, value sets, and other resources that drive interoperability. Indirectly, this improves the availability and usability of FHIR specifications, which can benefit healthcare practitioners and potentially patients as they lead to better data exchange and more effective healthcare. However, patients are not a direct user of this guide.
