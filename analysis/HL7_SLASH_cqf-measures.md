# cqf-measures: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The FHIR Quality Measure Implementation Guide (QM IG) aims to standardize the way electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) are represented and shared using the FHIR standard. It provides a common framework for defining eCQMs, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different healthcare systems and organizations in the US. This is particularly important for quality reporting, performance evaluation, and improvement initiatives.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

This IG builds upon and improves previous quality measurement standards like HQMF (Health Quality Measures Format) and QRDA (Quality Reporting Document Architecture) by:

* **Leveraging FHIR:** It utilizes the FHIR R4 standard, offering a more modern and robust approach compared to the older HL7 V3-based HQMF.
* **Integrating CQL:** It incorporates Clinical Quality Language (CQL), a more expressive and computable language than the previous QDM-based logic in HQMF, facilitating clearer and more precise definition of measure criteria.
* **Standardizing Data Models:** It promotes the use of QI-Core profiles, derived from US Core, as a consistent data model for quality measures, enhancing interoperability and data exchange.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

* **Measure Representation:** Uses the FHIR Measure resource to represent eCQMs, including metadata, terminology, data criteria, and population criteria.
* **CQL for Logic:** Employs CQL to define the logic for measure criteria, offering a human-readable yet computable representation.
* **ELM for Implementation:** Supports the use of Expression Logical Model (ELM), a machine-readable representation of CQL, for easier implementation in software systems.
* **Data Requirements:** Emphasizes the inclusion of data requirements in Library resources, facilitating data exchange and privacy compliance.
* **Terminology Management:** Provides guidance on referencing and managing code systems and value sets, ensuring consistency and accuracy in terminology use.
* **Artifact Packaging:** Defines standards for packaging measures and libraries, including dependencies and test cases, for efficient distribution and implementation.

## 4. Relationship to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

* **FHIR:** Aligns with the FHIR R4 standard, promoting interoperability and data exchange in healthcare.
* **US Core:** Builds upon US Core profiles, ensuring consistency with national data standards.
* **QI-Core:** Leverages QI-Core profiles for a standardized quality improvement data model.
* **CQL:** Adopts CQL as the standard expression language for defining measure criteria.
* **Regulatory Reporting:** Supports quality reporting requirements for initiatives like the Quality Payment Program (QPP).

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

* **Measure Developers:** Provides a standardized framework for authoring eCQMs.
* **Software Developers:** Guides the implementation of eCQMs in software systems and tools.
* **Healthcare Organizations:** Enables consistent implementation and reporting of quality measures.
* **Quality Agencies:** Facilitates the collection and analysis of standardized quality data.
* **Payers:** Supports quality measurement and reporting for value-based care programs.
* **Patients:** Ultimately benefits patients by promoting better quality of care through improved measurement and reporting.
