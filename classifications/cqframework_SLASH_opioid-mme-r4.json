  "rationale": "The opioid-mme-r4 Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining the logic and data structures necessary to calculate Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) for opioid medications. It specifies a method for calculating MME based on RxNorm codes, dose quantity, and doses per day. The IG provides detailed instructions on how to configure conversion factors using a CodeSystem supplement, with specific properties for defining conversion factors based on ingredient, dose form, or dose range. It also outlines how to use these conversion factors within the MME calculator, including handling different units and dose forms. The IG defines a profile (MMEMedicationRequest) to express the expectations for MedicationRequest resources used in the calculation. It includes cautions related to the use of MME calculations, emphasizing that they are estimates and should not be used for certain dosage decisions. The IG also provides downloadable resources, including the full implementation guide and format-specific definitions (XML and JSON). The primary purpose is to standardize the calculation of MME for opioid medications, particularly in the context of clinical decision support and medication management. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for use in the United States, referencing CDC guidelines for opioid prescribing.",
