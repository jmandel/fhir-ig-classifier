    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on enabling the standardized exchange of military service history and veteran status information, primarily within the US healthcare system. The design is driven by the need to verify veteran status and support clinical care and administrative workflows related to veteran benefits. Therefore, Clinical Care Teams and Healthcare Administrators are the core users, with Government Agencies (specifically the VA) having significant influence. Patients and Caregivers benefit from improved care coordination, while Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations can leverage the standardized data for population health and research purposes.",
