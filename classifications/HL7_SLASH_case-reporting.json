    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on electronic case reporting (eCR) using FHIR. It heavily relies on FHIR for its core structure and operations, defining FHIR profiles, extensions, and transactions for eICR, RR, and eRSD. While it acknowledges CDA through its relationship with previous CDA-based IGs, it doesn't actively utilize CDA structures. The IG doesn't use v2 or v3 directly. It demonstrates a degree of cross-paradigm awareness by referencing the relationship to prior CDA work and aiming for future alignment with the US Public Health Library.",

Government Agencies have a significant influence, as they set reporting requirements and oversee public health programs.
