# fhir-resp-net-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to improve the efficiency and timeliness of data exchange for respiratory virus hospitalization surveillance (RESP-NET). It seeks to automate the reporting process of hospitalized cases of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV by leveraging electronic health information (EHR) data. The context is public health surveillance, specifically within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RESP-NET program. It is for healthcare facilities, state/local public health partners, and the CDC.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG aims to reduce the manual and labor-intensive process of identifying cases through review of line lists and databases, and medical chart abstraction. It seeks to expand the utilization of EHR data, improve data exchange between healthcare facilities, state/local public health partners, and CDC, and reduce the burden of data collection on surveillance officers and healthcare facilities.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include the use of FHIR R4, MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) IG, US Core profiles, Subscriptions Backport IG, US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) IG, electronic Case Reporting (eCR) IG, and SMART App Launch IG. It defines specific requirements for data sources, Health Data Exchange Apps (HDEAs), and data receivers to conform with the specification, including data population, processing, and display requirements. It leverages SMART on FHIR Backend Services Authorization for security. It also uses subscriptions for event-driven data exchange. It defines a RESP-NET Content Bundle and Reporting Bundle for packaging and transmitting data. The IG utilizes Knowledge Artifacts to guide the reporting process.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG leverages existing HL7 FHIR standards, specifically R4, and aligns with US Core profiles for sharing health data in the U.S. It also builds upon the MedMorph RA IG for automation and the SMART App Launch IG for security. It uses the US Public Health Profiles Library IG as a complement to US Core and the electronic Case Reporting (eCR) IG for case reporting. The IG also references the Subscriptions Backport IG for automating reporting workflows.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are healthcare facilities (Data Source), public health agencies (Data Receiver), and the CDC. Implementers of HDEAs are also users. The beneficiaries are ultimately the public health system, which will have improved, more timely data for surveillance. Patients are indirect beneficiaries through improved public health surveillance and response, but they are not direct users.
