While it mentions specific programs like PEPFAR's DATIM and ONC TEFCA, these are presented as examples within a broader context. The guide does not define jurisdiction-specific rules or constraints beyond general applicability. Therefore, it is best classified as a Universal Realm guide.",

It is designed to support interoperability between various healthcare systems, particularly in the context of IHE Document Sharing. Therefore, Clinical Care Teams and Healthcare Administrators are the core users, as they need to find providers, facilities, and understand service availability. Public Health Agencies and Government Agencies also have a significant role due to the IG's focus on cross-jurisdictional data management and national health information infrastructure. Payers and Research Organizations have a less direct but still important role, while Patients and Caregivers are the least directly involved.",
