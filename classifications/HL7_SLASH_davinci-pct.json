  "rationale": "The DaVinci Patient Cost Transparency (PCT) Implementation Guide is focused on enabling providers to submit Good Faith Estimates (GFEs) to payers and for payers to return Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs). The IG defines a new workflow for coordinating the collection of GFEs from multiple providers. The core functionality involves defining the structure and content of GFE and AEOB bundles, which are composed of FHIR resources like Claim, ExplanationOfBenefit, Coverage, Organization, and Practitioner. \n\nThe IG introduces new profiles for GFE and AEOB bundles, as well as profiles for related resources. It defines operations like `$gfe-submit` for submitting a GFE bundle and polling for an AEOB response. The IG also specifies requirements for a new \"Coordination Platform\" to facilitate multi-provider GFE collection. The primary focus is on data modeling, defining the structure and content of the GFE and AEOB bundles using FHIR profiles. It also defines workflows and interactions between systems, such as the GFE submission and AEOB retrieval process. The IG is specific to the United States and is intended to support compliance with the No Surprises Act. \n\nThe IG is primarily targeted at technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, who will implement the defined workflows and data exchange mechanisms. It also has implications for healthcare provider organizations, particularly their IT and clinical care teams, as well as administrative organizations like insurance companies and health plans. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and defines several custom operations and search parameters. It includes numerous examples of FHIR resources and bundles to illustrate the defined profiles and workflows. The IG defines new code systems and value sets for specific concepts, such as GFE types and adjustment reasons. It also references external code systems like CPT, HCPCS, and ICD-10-CM.",
