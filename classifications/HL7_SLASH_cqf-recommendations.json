It leverages core FHIR resources and operations, along with CQL for expressing clinical logic. While it mentions applicability to any jurisdiction using clinical practice guidelines and references US initiatives, it does not explicitly state a primary focus on a specific country or region. Therefore, it is best classified as a Universal Realm guide.",
