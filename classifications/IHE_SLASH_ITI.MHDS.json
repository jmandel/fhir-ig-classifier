It heavily relies on FHIR resources and RESTful interactions, making FHIR the foundational standard. While it acknowledges and integrates with other HL7 standards through IHE profiles, these are secondary to the core FHIR approach. CDA and v2 are not directly relevant, and v3's influence is minimal, primarily through terminology and value sets.",
