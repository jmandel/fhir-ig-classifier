  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-gender-harmony\" focuses on defining a model and guidance for representing sex and gender information in healthcare systems, specifically within the context of HL7 standards. \n\n**Functional Domain:** While the guide touches upon various domains, its primary focus is on providing a foundational framework applicable across different areas. It doesn't define specific clinical workflows or specialize in a particular clinical specialty. Instead, it provides guidance on representing core concepts like gender identity, pronouns, and sex parameter for clinical use, which are relevant to infrastructure and foundational elements used by other IGs. Therefore, it scores highest in the \"Infrastructure & Foundational\" category.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The guide explicitly supports FHIR, CDA, and V2 standards, making it a \"Cross-Paradigm\" guide. It provides specific guidance and examples for each of these standards, demonstrating its commitment to interoperability across different HL7 product families. The guide's title and content indicate a strong emphasis on FHIR R5, but it also provides guidance for backward compatibility with R4.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The guide's primary purpose is \"Data Modeling.\" It defines a logical model for representing sex and gender and provides guidance on how to implement this model within FHIR, CDA, and V2. It also touches upon \"Data Exchange\" by providing examples of how to exchange this information using different HL7 standards. However, the focus is more on defining the structure and content of the data rather than the specific mechanisms for exchange.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** The guide is intended for international use, as indicated by its \"Universal Realm\" designation. It aims to provide a common framework for representing sex and gender that can be adopted globally. However, it also acknowledges the need for jurisdictional variations and provides guidance on how to accommodate these variations.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The guide is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including technical implementers (EHR vendors, system integrators), healthcare provider organizations (clinical care teams), and standards organizations. It provides guidance and examples that are relevant to each of these groups. The guide also indirectly impacts patient-facing stakeholders by promoting more accurate and respectful representation of their sex and gender information.",
