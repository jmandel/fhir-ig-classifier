It leverages FHIR's RESTful API and resource model as its foundation, making FHIR the core standard. While it aligns with Dutch ZIB 2017 standards, which may have some relation to v3, the IG does not directly utilize v3 or v2 messaging. CDA is not relevant as the focus is on granular data exchange, not document exchange. Cross-paradigm integration is limited, primarily focusing on FHIR.",
