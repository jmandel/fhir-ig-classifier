    "summary": "The CH EMED Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR R4 for representing and exchanging medication-related documents within the Swiss EPR. It leverages FHIR resources and profiles extensively, making FHIR the core standard. While it acknowledges its origins in HL7 CDA-CH-EMED and draws inspiration from IHE Pharmacy profiles, it does not directly integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. The IG demonstrates a deliberate effort to support cross-paradigm interoperability by transitioning from CDA to FHIR and aligning with IHE concepts.",
