    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on the FHIR standard, defining a RESTful approach for exchanging health promotion data in Denmark. It leverages FHIR resources and profiles extensively, making FHIR the core standard. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it doesn't directly integrate or require them. The IG demonstrates a cross-paradigm approach by utilizing FHIR to represent concepts that might traditionally be found in other HL7 standards, but it doesn't explicitly integrate with them. There is no mention or use of CDA, v2, or v3 in the IG.",
