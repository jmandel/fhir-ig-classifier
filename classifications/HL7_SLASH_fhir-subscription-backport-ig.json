  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-subscription-backport-ig\" focuses on enabling pre-R5 FHIR servers to implement a subset of R5 Subscriptions. It defines extensions, profiles, and operations to achieve this. \n\n**Functionality:** The IG does not directly deal with clinical care, public health, or research data. Instead, it provides the infrastructure for a subscription mechanism, making it a foundational element. It defines how subscriptions can be created, managed, and used for notifications, but not the specific clinical or administrative content of those subscriptions.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The IG is primarily concerned with FHIR, specifically enabling R4 and R4B servers to implement R5-style subscriptions. It defines profiles for R4 and R4B resources and operations to achieve compatibility. It also mentions the possibility of using Basic resources to represent R5 SubscriptionTopic in R4.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The IG's primary purpose is to define data models and mechanisms for data exchange related to subscriptions. It defines profiles for Subscription, Bundle, and Parameters resources, as well as extensions for various elements. It also specifies operations like $status, $events, and $get-ws-binding-token. The focus is on enabling interoperability by standardizing how subscriptions are represented and managed.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** The IG is published by HL7 International and is intended for international use, as indicated by the \"uv\" (universal realm) in the package ID. The jurisdiction is set to \"World\".\n\n**Stakeholders:** The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, particularly EHR vendors and system integrators who need to implement the backported subscription functionality on FHIR R4 and R4B servers. The IG also indirectly impacts healthcare provider organizations and public health organizations by enabling standardized subscription mechanisms.",
