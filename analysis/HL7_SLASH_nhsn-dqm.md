# nhsn-dqm: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to define how to electronically report healthcare data to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for the purposes of data quality measurement (dQM). It specifies how systems should exchange data related to patient care, specifically for measure evaluation. The context is public health reporting in the US, and the target audience includes systems that collect, aggregate, and evaluate healthcare data for reporting to NHSN.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG provides a structured, FHIR-based approach for data aggregation and measure evaluation, intended to replace or enhance existing methods. It specifically mentions addressing incompatibilities between DEQM and SANER approaches for aggregation, suggesting it seeks to improve upon previous attempts at standardized aggregation.  It also incorporates US Core profiles for data exchange.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
        *   Defining CapabilityStatements for various actors (Data Aggregator, Data Source, Evaluation Engine, Measure Source, MeasureReport Recipient).
        *   Using US Core profiles for patient and other clinical resources.
        *   Importing DEQM profiles for reporting and evaluation, and CQFM profiles for measure artifacts.
        *   Defining a custom CodeSystem (HealthareCapacityCodeSystem) for healthcare capacity reporting.
        *   Specifying a custom profile (NHSNMeasureReportBundle) for submission bundles.
        *   Implementing the $evaluate-measure operation for measure evaluation.
        *   Implementing the $validate operation for measure report validation.
        *   Providing CQL-based libraries for measure logic and data requirements.
        *   Specifying the use of FHIR resources like MeasureReport, Bundle, Patient, Encounter, Observation, etc.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG utilizes FHIR as its foundational standard, aligning with interoperability initiatives. It leverages US Core profiles and DEQM standards. It is focused on reporting to the NHSN, a public health surveillance system in the US, suggesting relevance to public health regulations and reporting requirements. The profiles and code systems defined are specific to the NHSN context and US healthcare system.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    Primary users and beneficiaries include:
        *   **Healthcare Facilities:** That need to report data to NHSN, such as hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and psychiatric facilities.
        *   **Public Health Agencies:** That collect and analyze data from these facilities, such as state health agencies.
        *   **Health IT Vendors:** That develop systems for data collection, aggregation, and reporting.
        *   **Data Aggregators:** Systems that aggregate data from multiple sources before measure evaluation, such as state public health agencies.
        *   **Evaluation Engines:** Systems that perform measure evaluation using data from data sources.

    While patients are not direct users, they are indirect beneficiaries as the data collected and reported using this IG will be used to improve healthcare quality and safety. The data collected using the IG will be used for public health monitoring and to improve care delivery.
