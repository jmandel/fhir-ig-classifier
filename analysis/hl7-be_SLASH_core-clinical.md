# core-clinical: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to define a set of FHIR profiles, code systems, and value sets for use within the Belgian healthcare system, specifically for clinical data exchange. It provides a structured way to represent clinical information such as problems, observations, scores, and encounters, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare IT systems in Belgium. The primary goal is to facilitate the exchange of clinical data in a standardized manner, according to the needs of the eHealth platform in Belgium.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG introduces FHIR profiles for several clinical resources (e.g., `BeProblem`, `BeObservation`, `BeEncounter`, `BeScoreResult`) which are based on the functional description of the NIHDI (National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance), and defines specific extensions (e.g., `BeExtLaterality`, `BeExtProblemOriginType`). It standardizes the representation of clinical information with controlled terminologies, such as SNOMED-CT for body site and laterality, and defines specific code systems and value sets for problem categories, origin types, and scores. This structured approach improves on potentially inconsistent or non-standardized ways of exchanging clinical data. Also, it provides specific French and Dutch designations for several concepts, reflecting the multilingual context of Belgium.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **FHIR Profiles:** Defining profiles for core clinical resources like `Appointment`, `CarePlan`, `ClinicalImpression`, `Encounter`, `Goal`, `Observation`, `Problem`, `Procedure`, `QuestionnaireResponse`, `ScoreResult` and `ServiceRequest`, with specific constraints and extensions to meet Belgian requirements.
    *   **Code Systems:** Defining code systems like `BeCSBodySite`, `BeCSProblemCategory`, `BeCSProblemOriginType`, `BeCSScore`, and `BeCSScoreCategory` to provide controlled vocabularies for specific concepts.
    *   **Value Sets:** Defining value sets like `BeVSBodySite`, `BeVSLaterality`, `BeVSProblemCategory`, `BeVSProblemOriginType`, `BeVSReactionManifestationCode`, `BeVSScore`, and `BeVSScoreCategory` to provide specific sets of codes for use in the profiles.
    *   **Extensions:** Defining extensions like `BeExtLaterality` and `BeExtProblemOriginType` to add specific information to FHIR resources.
    *   **Terminology Bindings:** Binding value sets to specific elements within the profiles to ensure consistent use of codes.
    *   **Multilingual Support:** Providing French and Dutch designations for code system concepts.
    *   **Use of SNOMED CT:** Leveraging SNOMED-CT for coding body sites and laterality.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is built on the FHIR standard, which is a globally recognized standard for healthcare data exchange. It is specifically tailored to the Belgian context, aligning with the eHealth Platform and incorporating elements based on the NIHDI functional descriptions. It explicitly references the ISO 3166 standard for country codes by using `urn:iso:std:iso:3166#BE` as the jurisdiction in the metadata of the different artifacts. This implies a commitment to aligning with international standards while addressing specific national needs.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users of this IG are healthcare IT system developers and implementers within Belgium. These implementers will use the profiles, code systems, and value sets to build interoperable systems for sharing clinical data between healthcare providers and organizations. The indirect beneficiaries are healthcare professionals who will be able to access and exchange patient information more efficiently and accurately. Patients also benefit indirectly through improved care coordination and data access, as well as more standardized and consistent recording of their health information by healthcare providers.
