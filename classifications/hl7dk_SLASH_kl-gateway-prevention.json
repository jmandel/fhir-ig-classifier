  "rationale": "The `kl-gateway-prevention` Implementation Guide (IG) is focused on defining the structure and content of data exchanged between Danish municipalities and the KL Gateway for reporting ยง119 disease prevention and health promotion activities. This IG primarily establishes data models and profiles based on FHIR R4, specifically tailored for the Danish healthcare context. \n\nThe core functionality of this IG revolves around creating a set of FHIR profiles that constrain and extend standard FHIR resources to meet the specific requirements of reporting ยง119 data. These profiles include `KLGateway119Citizen`, `KLGateway119Organization`, `KLGateway119ServiceRequest`, `KLGateway119FocusCondition`, `KLGateway119PlannedIntervention`, `KLGateway119CarePlan`, `KLGateway119Encounter`, and `KLGateway119Condition`. Each profile defines specific attributes, data types, cardinalities, and value sets that must be used when reporting data. The `KLGateway119DeliveryReport` profile defines the structure of the bundle used to transmit the data, ensuring that it contains one citizen and a collection of related resources.\n\nThis IG does not define new workflows or clinical guidelines but rather specifies how existing workflows and clinical data should be represented using FHIR resources for reporting purposes. It leverages existing Danish core profiles and aligns with the ongoing work on a shared information model (FKI) for data in Danish municipalities. The IG also includes examples of how to use the profiles to report various scenarios, such as the progression of a citizen through a care pathway.\n\nIn essence, the `kl-gateway-prevention` IG is a technical specification for data modeling and exchange, focusing on the \"what\" (data structure) rather than the \"how\" (data exchange mechanisms). It is designed to ensure that data reported to the KL Gateway is standardized, consistent, and interoperable, facilitating the aggregation and analysis of prevention and health promotion data at a national level.",
