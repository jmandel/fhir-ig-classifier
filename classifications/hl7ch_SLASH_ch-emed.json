  "rationale": "The CH EMED (R4) implementation guide focuses on defining the structure and content of various eMedication documents used in Switzerland. These documents include the Medication Treatment Plan, Medication Prescription, Medication Dispense, Pharmaceutical Advice, Medication List, and Medication Card. The guide specifies how these documents are represented using FHIR resources, primarily as Bundles containing a Composition resource and other referenced resources like MedicationStatement, MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense, and Observation. \n\nThe guide defines specific profiles for each document type, detailing the required and optional elements, data types, and value sets to be used. It also provides guidance on dosage representation, repeated dispense, authorship, and the relationships between different eMedication documents. The guide emphasizes the use of UUIDs for identifiers and defines extensions to link related documents and resources. \n\nBased on the artifacts defined within the IG, it is clear that the primary focus is on data modeling, specifically defining the structure and content of eMedication documents using FHIR profiles. It also touches upon data exchange by specifying how these documents are represented as FHIR Bundles, which can be exchanged between systems. The guide is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for use within the Swiss national jurisdiction. It primarily targets healthcare provider organizations, particularly clinical care teams, and technical implementers such as EHR vendors. The content strongly suggests that the primary functional domain is clinical care, with a specific focus on general clinical care, particularly medication management.",
