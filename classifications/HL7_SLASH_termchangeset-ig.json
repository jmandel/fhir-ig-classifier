  "rationale": "This IG focuses on defining a structured way to represent and manage changes to terminologies, which falls under the Infrastructure and Foundational domain. It is explicitly based on FHIR R4 and primarily deals with data exchange to support interoperability. Its scope is universal since it defines a general approach to terminology management, and the data is not specific to any particular setting but rather focuses on terminology data. The IG is currently in a draft/trial use phase.",
