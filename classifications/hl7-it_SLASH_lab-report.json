It heavily emphasizes the structure and content of clinical data related to laboratory tests and results, making **Clinical Data** and **Diagnostics** the core domains. While it touches upon administrative aspects like patient demographics and provider information, these are primarily in service of the main goal. The IG also addresses workflow aspects related to the exchange of lab reports and has implications for public health by enabling data aggregation, but these are secondary to the core focus on clinical data and diagnostics.",
