While it acknowledges and maps concepts from XDS (which uses ebRIM - an OASIS standard that HL7 v3 leverages), it does not directly utilize HL7 v2 or v3 messaging. It does show how to handle a CDA document, but only as an opaque document to be wrapped in FHIR resources. The guide demonstrates a deliberate effort to bridge the gap between FHIR and XDS, indicating a cross-paradigm approach.",

While it touches upon administrative aspects through document management and workflow through defined transactions, its core purpose is to facilitate the exchange of clinical documents in a mobile-friendly manner. Identity & Security is addressed through audit logging and potential integration with IUA, but not as a central focus.
