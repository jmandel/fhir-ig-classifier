# fhir-bfdr: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the exchange of birth and fetal death information between healthcare providers and jurisdictional Vital Records Offices (VROs) using the FHIR standard. It facilitates the electronic reporting of birth and fetal death data, replacing traditional paper-based methods.  This IG aligns with national data collection efforts in the United States, supporting the creation of vital records and the transmission of data to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

This IG directly enhances the exchange of birth and fetal death information by leveraging the FHIR standard. It improves upon previous approaches by:
  - Enabling structured, standardized data exchange, replacing paper-based forms with FHIR resources.
  - Facilitating electronic transmission of data, streamlining the reporting process.
  - Aligning with national standards for data collection and reporting.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

  - **FHIR Profiles:** The IG defines specialized FHIR profiles for resources like Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, and Procedure, tailored to the specific data elements required for birth and fetal death reporting.
  - **Value Sets:** The IG utilizes standard and custom value sets to ensure consistent coding of data elements, promoting interoperability.
  - **Concept Maps:** Concept maps within the IG establish mappings between FHIR terminology and existing coding systems used for birth and fetal death data (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD-10).
  - **Bundle Profiles:** The IG defines bundle profiles to represent complete birth and fetal death reports, packaging relevant FHIR resources together for transmission.
  - **Composition Resource:** The Composition resource is used to structure the overall birth or fetal death report, organizing information into sections that align with traditional reporting forms.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The BFDR IG aligns with the following standards and regulations:

  - **HL7 FHIR Standard:** The IG is based on the HL7 FHIR standard, ensuring compatibility with broader healthcare data exchange initiatives.
  - **US Core Profiles:** The IG leverages US Core profiles, aligning with national standards for patient and clinical data representation.
  - **NCHS Reporting Requirements:** The IG adheres to NCHS reporting requirements for birth and fetal death data, supporting national data collection efforts.
  - **Federal Law 42 USC 405(c):** The IG addresses the legal requirement for collecting Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for parents and children, as mandated by Federal Law 42 USC 405(c).

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

  - **Healthcare Providers:** Providers responsible for recording and reporting birth and fetal death information (e.g., hospitals, birthing centers, physicians).
  - **Jurisdictional VROs:** Government agencies responsible for registering births and fetal deaths, issuing birth certificates, and maintaining vital records.
  - **NCHS:** The National Center for Health Statistics, responsible for collecting and analyzing national vital statistics data.
  - **Patients and Families:** Individuals and families benefit from the accurate and efficient registration of births and fetal deaths, providing legal documentation and supporting public health research.

The BFDR IG facilitates the electronic exchange of vital records information, leading to more efficient and accurate reporting, improved data quality, and enhanced public health surveillance and research.
