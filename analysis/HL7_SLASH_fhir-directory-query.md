# fhir-directory-query: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to enable federated queries for healthcare provider directories. It defines a standard way for different systems to share and access directory information, such as provider details, locations, and services. This allows for a more interconnected and up-to-date view of healthcare resources, primarily targeting organizations that need to exchange directory information and applications that need to consume or display this information.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** The IG leverages FHIR standards to create a defined model for representing and exchanging directory data. It introduces profiles for resources like `Endpoint`, `HealthcareService`, `Location`, `Organization`, `Practitioner`, `PractitionerRole`, `InsurancePlan` and a new `Restriction` resource based on consent, as well as `VerificationResult`. These profiles standardize the structure and content of directory information, which may be inconsistent in prior implementations. The IG also defines specific search parameters for these profiles, enabling structured queries that were not possible before.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include the use of FHIR profiles to constrain existing resources and create new ones. The IG specifies several search parameters for each profile, allowing clients to query data based on specific criteria (e.g., by name, location, service type, etc.). It employs RESTful interactions for accessing directory data. It also includes rulesets for defining capability statements, outlining server requirements.  Extensions are used extensively to add specific constraints to the base FHIR resources. CodeSystems and ValueSets are defined to control the terminology used in the IG.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** The IG builds on the FHIR standard, and uses US Core profiles as a base. It also uses code systems and value sets from LOINC, SNOMED CT, and HL7 code systems and value sets. The IG is also aligned with the National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) Health Care Provider Taxonomy code set. The IG considers and makes use of general security considerations as defined in the FHIR standard.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are organizations needing to share and access healthcare directory information, such as payers, providers, healthcare networks, and directories. It also benefits applications that need to display or consume directory data. Patients are indirect beneficiaries, as improved directory data can help them access the right care and resources more efficiently through applications that are built using this standard.
