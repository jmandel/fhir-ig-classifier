  "rationale": "This implementation guide defines a set of FHIR profiles, extensions, and value sets tailored for the Danish eHealth Infrastructure. It focuses on defining FHIR profiles with extensions and bindings to create interoperable applications. The guide specifies various FHIR artifacts like profiles, extensions, search parameters, operations, and capability statements. It also includes a changelog detailing modifications made to the guide over time. The guide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 and is intended for use within Denmark, as indicated by the jurisdiction specified in the configuration. The guide defines custom operations, code systems, value sets, concept maps, and search parameters. It also specifies resource/profile changes, including extensions and invariants. The guide's primary focus is on data modeling and defining how data should be structured and represented within the Danish eHealth Infrastructure. It also touches upon data exchange through the definition of operations and capability statements. The guide is intended for a technical audience, including implementers and developers working with FHIR resources within the Danish healthcare system.",
