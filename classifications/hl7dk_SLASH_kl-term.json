    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining a terminology framework for Danish municipal health and social care using FHIR ValueSets. It heavily relies on FHIR for its structure and incorporates SNOMED CT for specific observations. While it bridges two existing Danish terminologies (FSIII and FFB), it doesn't directly support HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. The IG demonstrates a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by integrating FHIR with existing terminologies, but its primary focus is on FHIR-based terminology.",

It primarily impacts EHR systems used within Danish municipalities for managing health and social care information. While it doesn't define specific profiles or operations, the extensive use of ValueSets for conditions, observations, interventions, and other concepts suggests a significant role for EHR systems in implementing the IG. Other systems like Pharmacy, Imaging, and Lab are not directly addressed. Payer systems are not in scope. Public Health systems may benefit from aggregated data, and Research Platforms could utilize the standardized terminology for data analysis. PHR systems could potentially leverage the citizen observation codes. Clinical Decision Support systems might use the standardized terminology for triggering rules, but the IG doesn't explicitly define CDS functionality.",
