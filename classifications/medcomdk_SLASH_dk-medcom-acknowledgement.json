  "rationale": "The dk-medcom-acknowledgement Implementation Guide defines a system for acknowledging the receipt and processing status of MedCom FHIR messages within the Danish healthcare system. It specifies the structure and content of acknowledgement messages, including mandatory elements like response codes and optional elements like OperationOutcome for detailed error reporting.\n\nThis IG primarily focuses on defining a specific type of message within the broader MedCom FHIR messaging framework. It establishes the MedComAcknowledgementMessage profile, which inherits from the general MedComMessagingMessage profile and mandates the use of the MedComAcknowledgementMessageHeader. This header profile, in turn, inherits from MedComMessagingMessageHeader and adds constraints such as disallowing carbon-copy recipients and requiring a response code indicating the message processing status (ok, fatal-error, transient-error).\n\nFurthermore, the IG introduces the MedComAcknowledgementOperationOutcome profile, designed to provide detailed information about errors encountered during message processing. This profile is intended for use when the response code is not 'ok' but can also be included for informational purposes even with an 'ok' response, such as indicating a duplicate message.\n\nThe IG also provides guidance on the use of timestamps within the acknowledgement message, including Bundle.timestamp, Provenance.occuredDateTime[x], and Provenance.recorded, clarifying their different purposes and registration times.\n\nIn terms of data exchange, the IG specifies how acknowledgement messages are to be transported, primarily using the VANSenvelope format, and outlines the relevant fields within the envelope that are influenced by FHIR. It also provides examples of acknowledgement messages and references relevant code systems and value sets defined in the MedCom Terminology IG.\n\nOverall, the dk-medcom-acknowledgement IG establishes a standardized mechanism for acknowledging FHIR messages within the Danish healthcare context, focusing on data modeling for the acknowledgement message itself and defining the data exchange process using existing infrastructure like VANSenvelope.",
