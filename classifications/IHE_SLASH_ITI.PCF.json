  "rationale": "The ITI.PCF Implementation Guide focuses on defining mechanisms for managing and enforcing privacy consents within the context of FHIR APIs used to access Document Sharing Health Information Exchanges. It defines a set of FHIR profiles and extensions to represent patient privacy consents, building upon the IUA profile for authentication and authorization. \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines:\n\n1.  **FHIR Consent Profiles:** Three profiles are defined: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, each offering increasing levels of granularity and complexity for representing consent directives. These profiles specify how to represent various aspects of a consent, such as the governing policy, the timeframe of the consent, the permitted or denied actors, and the purpose of use. The Intermediate and Advanced profiles further allow for specifying data-level restrictions based on authorship, related resources, timeframes, and security labels.\n2.  **Security Labeling Service (SLS) Guidance:** While not mandating a specific SLS implementation, the IG provides guidance on how security labels can be used to classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., substance abuse, mental health) and confidentiality (e.g., normal, restricted). It includes example ValueSets for sensitivity classifications.\n3.  **OAuth 2.0 Extensions:** The IG extends the IUA profile's use of OAuth 2.0 by defining new extensions (`ihe_pcf`) to be included in access tokens. These extensions communicate consent-based restrictions from the Consent Authorization Server to the Consent Enforcement Point, enabling fine-grained access control based on the patient's consent.\n4.  **Transactions:** The IG defines the ITI-108 transaction for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and searching for Consent resources. It also outlines how the ITI-71 transaction (Get Access Token) is modified to incorporate consent information.\n5.  **Actors:** The IG defines four key actors: Consent Recorder, Consent Registry, Consent Authorization Server, and Consent Enforcement Point. These actors interact to manage, evaluate, and enforce privacy consents.\n\nBased on these artifacts, the primary focus of the ITI.PCF IG is on data modeling (defining FHIR profiles for consent) and data exchange (specifying how consent information is communicated and enforced). It also touches upon security and privacy by providing guidance on security labeling and defining mechanisms for enforcing consent-based access control. The IG does not specify a particular geographic scope, but it references international standards and code systems, suggesting a potential for universal realm applicability. However, some examples and discussions hint at a US-centric context.",
