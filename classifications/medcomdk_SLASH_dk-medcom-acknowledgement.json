It primarily impacts systems that send and receive FHIR messages within this ecosystem, ensuring reliable communication. EHR systems are central to this, as they are likely the primary senders and receivers of clinical messages. Systems that generate or process these messages will need to implement the acknowledgement mechanism. Payer systems are less relevant as this IG doesn't deal with financial transactions. Public health systems might use this for aggregated data reporting acknowledgements, but it's not a primary focus.",
