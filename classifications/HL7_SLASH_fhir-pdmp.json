  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-pdmp\" defines a system for querying state-based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). The core functionality revolves around a FHIR operation (`pdmp-history`) that allows authorized requesters to submit patient information and retrieve a history of controlled substance dispensations. The IG specifies the structure of the request and response using FHIR resources, primarily `Parameters` and `Bundle`. The request `Parameters` resource includes details about the patient, the authorized practitioner, and their organization. The response `Parameters` resource can contain either a `Bundle` with discrete FHIR resources representing the PDMP history (including `MedicationDispense`, `Patient`, `Organization`, etc.) or a URL pointing to a formatted report, or both. The IG also supports messaging-based submission using a `MessageHeader` and `Bundle`. The IG defines specific profiles for key resources like `Patient`, `MedicationDispense`, and `Organization` to ensure consistency and interoperability. It also defines extensions to capture PDMP-specific data elements like fill number, transmission method, and morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The IG leverages US Core profiles for representing practitioners, organizations, and related persons. The primary focus is on standardizing data exchange between EHRs and PDMP systems within the United States, with an emphasis on supporting regulatory requirements and clinical workflows related to controlled substance prescribing and dispensing.",
