It heavily relies on FHIR R4 resources, profiles, and operations, with no significant use of other HL7 standards like CDA, v2, or v3. While it doesn't explicitly mention cross-paradigm integration, the use of FHIR alongside other IGs suggests some level of interoperability across different approaches.",

EHRs will need to integrate to consume and potentially contribute to this directory. Payers will be heavily involved in both contributing and consuming data for enrollment, credentialing, and network management. Public health systems may leverage the directory for population health initiatives. PHR systems could use it to help patients find providers. Research platforms might use it for identifying potential study participants or sites. Clinical decision support, imaging, lab, and pharmacy systems have minimal direct involvement.",
