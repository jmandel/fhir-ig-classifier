  "rationale": "The `termchangeset-ig` defines a set of FHIR profiles and extensions specifically designed to represent terminology change sets. These change sets capture incremental updates to terminologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC. \n\nThe core of the IG is the `ChangeSet` profile, which is a specialization of the FHIR `CodeSystem` resource. This profile includes metadata about the change set (e.g., version, publisher, copyright) and defines how to represent concepts and their properties within the change set. It emphasizes the use of `CodeSystem.property` to capture additional information about concepts, following terminology-specific guidance. The IG also defines several extensions, such as `description-case-sensitivity`, `description-acceptability`, `role-group`, `defining-relationship-type`, `el-profile-set-operator`, and `description-dialect`, which are used to provide more granular details about concept designations and properties. \n\nFurthermore, the IG provides specialized profiles for representing SNOMED CT and LOINC change sets (`SNOMEDChangeSet` and `LOINCChangeSet`). These profiles further constrain the `ChangeSet` profile by defining specific properties relevant to each terminology. For example, the `LOINCChangeSet` profile defines slices for properties like `COMPONENT`, `PROPERTY`, `TIME_ASPCT`, `SYSTEM`, `SCALE_TYP`, and many others, reflecting the LOINC multi-axial hierarchy. Similarly, the `SNOMEDChangeSet` profile defines slices for properties like `inactive`, `definitionStatusId`, `parent`, `moduleId`, and numerous relationship types (e.g., `Due_to`, `Associated_with`, `Finding_site`). \n\nFinally, the IG defines a `TerminologyChangeSetProvenance` profile, which is a specialization of the FHIR `Provenance` resource. This profile is used to capture the provenance of a terminology change set, including information about the authors, the custodian, the reason for the change set, and the baseline version of the terminology to which the change set applies. The IG also includes examples of how to use these profiles to represent change sets for HL7, LOINC, and SNOMED CT.",
