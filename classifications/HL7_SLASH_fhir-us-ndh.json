Clinical Care Teams benefit from improved referral processes and access to accurate provider data. Healthcare Administrators gain efficiency in managing directory information and reducing redundant data entry. Payers leverage the directory for network management and claims processing. Public Health Agencies can utilize the directory for population health analysis and resource planning. Government Agencies play a crucial role in oversight and regulation of the national directory. While Patients and Caregivers may indirectly benefit from improved provider selection, their direct involvement is minimal. Research Organizations have a limited role, potentially using the directory for study recruitment or data analysis.",
