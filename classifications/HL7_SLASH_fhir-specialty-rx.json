    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on standardizing the exchange of patient data for specialty medication fulfillment using FHIR R4. It heavily relies on FHIR resources, operations, and messaging, with no direct dependency on CDA, v2, or v3. While it acknowledges the existence of other standards like NCPDP SCRIPT, it primarily operates within the FHIR ecosystem. It does support both RESTful and messaging paradigms within FHIR, thus showing some cross-paradigm support within the FHIR specification.",

It leverages FHIR R4 to define profiles, operations, and workflows for sharing patient demographics, clinical data, consent, and coverage information between prescribers, pharmacies, specialty hubs, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. While it touches upon various domains, its core purpose revolves around medications, particularly specialty medications, and the associated administrative and workflow processes.",
