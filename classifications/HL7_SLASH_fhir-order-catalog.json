It heavily relies on FHIR resources and RESTful interactions, with no mention or use of CDA, v2, or v3. While it leverages multiple FHIR resources and terminologies, indicating some level of cross-paradigm thinking within the FHIR ecosystem, it doesn't integrate with other HL7 paradigms.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on creating a standardized way to represent and exchange catalogs of orderable healthcare items, primarily medical devices, medications, and laboratory services. It leverages FHIR resources like Composition, DeviceDefinition, MedicationKnowledge, and PlanDefinition to define catalog structure, item details, and search capabilities. While it touches upon administrative aspects through catalog management and indirectly supports clinical data through item descriptions, its core purpose is to facilitate the discovery and selection of orderable items, making it heavily focused on the workflow of item selection and indirectly supporting procurement.",

EHRs will need to integrate with these catalogs for ordering and documentation. Pharmacy and Lab systems will be key in providing and consuming catalog data. While not directly involved in ordering, Clinical Decision Support systems may leverage catalog information for relevant guidance. Payer systems have minimal involvement as the IG doesn't cover billing. Public Health and Research systems have limited interaction, primarily for epidemiological studies or device/drug tracking.

It's designed to facilitate efficient discovery, selection, and ordering by providing a common information model and standardized search capabilities. Therefore, the core users are those involved in managing and utilizing these catalogs, such as clinical care teams (for selection) and healthcare administrators (for procurement). Government agencies and device manufacturers also have a significant role in ensuring data consistency and compliance with regulatory requirements.
