  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"FormatCode\" primarily focuses on defining and managing a vocabulary (specifically, a CodeSystem and ValueSet) for identifying the technical format of healthcare documents. This vocabulary, known as \"FormatCode,\" is used as metadata to specify the detailed technical structure and profiled constraints of a document, going beyond the basic format indicated by the mimeType. The IG emphasizes that FormatCode is more specific than both mimeType and document type, as it indicates the specific requirements and constraints of the document's content.\n\nThe IG provides background information on FormatCode, details the codes defined by IHE for use in FormatCode, and presents the IHE-managed ValueSet for FormatCode. It also outlines the process for submitting changes to the IHE FormatCode vocabulary and provides links to download the entire guide, the CodeSystem and ValueSet in JSON and XML formats, and the source code.\n\nGiven that the IG's core function is to define and manage a vocabulary for describing document formats, it strongly aligns with the \"Data Modeling\" aspect of the \"Scope/Purpose\" axis. It also touches upon \"Data Exchange\" as FormatCode is used as metadata to facilitate interoperability. The IG is based on FHIR, as indicated by its structure and the use of FHIR resources like CodeSystem and ValueSet. While it references IHE and HL7 standards, the IG itself is a FHIR implementation guide. The geographic scope is primarily Universal Realm, as it is managed by IHE, an international organization, although it does include references to HL7 codes, which may have a US focus. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, particularly those involved in document exchange and processing, such as EHR vendors and system integrators. It also indirectly impacts healthcare provider organizations and potentially public health organizations that rely on standardized document formats for data exchange.",
