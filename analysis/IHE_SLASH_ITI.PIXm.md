# ITI.PIXm: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The ITI.PIXm (Patient Identifier Cross-reference for Mobile) Implementation Guide (IG) aims to enable secure and standardized exchange of patient identity information between mobile and lightweight healthcare applications and a central Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. This IG defines a lightweight RESTful interface leveraging FHIR R4 resources and operations to facilitate:

- **Patient Identity Feed:** Mobile applications acting as Patient Identity Sources can send updates (add, revise, resolve duplicates, remove) about patient identities to the central manager.
- **Patient Identifier Cross-referencing:** Mobile applications acting as Patient Identifier Cross-reference Consumers can query the manager for a patient's identifiers across different healthcare domains using a known identifier.

The objective is to provide a streamlined mechanism for mobile applications to participate in patient identity management and access accurate patient data across various healthcare systems.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The ITI.PIXm IG leverages the FHIR R4 standard for data exchange, providing a modern and interoperable approach compared to previous profiles like PIX and PIXV3, which relied on HL7 v2 and v3 messaging. The RESTful architecture and JSON/XML encoding cater to the needs of mobile and lightweight applications.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **FHIR R4-based:** Leverages FHIR resources (Patient, Parameters, OperationOutcome) and operations for defining data structures and interactions.
- **RESTful Architecture:** Employs HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, DELETE) for querying and updating patient information.
- **Operation-based Query:** Introduces the `$ihe-pix` operation for querying cross-referenced patient identifiers.
- **Security Considerations:** Integrates with ATNA and IUA profiles for secure communication, access control, and audit logging.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Designed for mobile applications with lightweight message encoding and simplified interactions.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The IG aligns with HL7 FHIR R4, a widely recognized standard for healthcare data exchange. It also integrates with IHE profiles like ATNA and IUA, addressing security and privacy concerns. By promoting standardized patient identity management, the IG contributes to interoperability and data accuracy, supporting regulatory requirements related to patient privacy and data security.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Mobile Application Developers:** The IG provides specifications for building mobile apps that can participate in patient identity management and access cross-referenced patient data.
- **Healthcare Providers:** Clinicians using mobile apps can benefit from accurate patient identification and access to consolidated patient information across different systems.
- **Patients:** Improved patient identification accuracy can lead to safer and more efficient care, potentially benefiting patients through better care coordination and reduced medical errors.

The IG primarily targets developers and healthcare providers, with indirect benefits for patients through improved data accuracy and care coordination.
