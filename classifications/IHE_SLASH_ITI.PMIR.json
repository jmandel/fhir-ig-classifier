It does not use CDA, v2, or v3, focusing solely on a FHIR-based approach. While it integrates with other IHE profiles that might use different standards, the PMIR profile itself is strictly FHIR. It acknowledges other IHE profiles, which implies some level of cross-paradigm awareness, but the core implementation is FHIR-only.",
