## Core Purpose & Scope

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) addresses the primary interoperability challenges of standardizing the electronic exchange of birth and fetal death information between healthcare providers, vital records offices, and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It solves key clinical and business problems related to timely, accurate, and complete reporting of birth and fetal death data, replacing existing paper-based and legacy electronic formats. The IG's scope is bounded to the data elements and workflows required for birth and fetal death reporting in the United States, including demographic, medical, and administrative information. It does not cover other vital events like marriage or divorce.

## Technical Foundation

The technical foundation of the IG rests on a set of core FHIR profiles built upon US Core and other relevant IGs. Key profiles include `Patient` (for mother, child, and fetus), `Encounter` (for birth and maternity encounters), `Observation` (for a wide range of clinical and demographic data), `Condition`, `Procedure`, `Practitioner`, `Location`, `Coverage`, and `Bundle` (for packaging and transmitting data). Notable extensions define elements like jurisdictional facility identifiers, edit flags, and roles. The IG defines operations for submitting birth and fetal death reports as FHIR documents. Key terminology is drawn from LOINC, SNOMED CT, and custom value sets for concepts like fetal death cause or condition, delivery routes, and edit flags. Significant patterns include the use of `Bundle` resources to represent birth and fetal death reports, and the use of `Composition` resources to structure the reports. Constraints are placed on cardinality and data types to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Technical Essence

This IG defines a comprehensive framework for representing and exchanging birth and fetal death information using FHIR. It leverages `Bundle` resources of type `document` to encapsulate complete reports, with a `Composition` resource serving as the index and linking to profiled resources representing the core data. `Patient` profiles are defined for the mother, child, and decedent fetus, with extensions for vital records-specific data like birth place and parent's education level. `Encounter` profiles capture the birth and maternity encounters, with links to relevant `Practitioner` and `Location` resources. A large set of `Observation` profiles capture detailed clinical and demographic data, including pregnancy risk factors, labor and delivery characteristics, newborn conditions, and coded cause of fetal death. `Condition` and `Procedure` profiles represent specific medical events and interventions. The IG mandates the use of specific value sets for coded data, including LOINC for observations and SNOMED CT for conditions. Data exchange is facilitated through operations that define the submission of `Bundle` documents to vital records systems. The IG also defines a mechanism for reporting coded race and ethnicity data to NCHS, using a dedicated `Composition` and `Observation` profiles.

## Implementation Approach

The IG is intended to be implemented by EHR vendors, health information exchanges, and vital records systems. Critical workflows include the extraction of relevant data from EHRs, mapping to FHIR profiles, packaging into `Bundle` documents, and submission to vital records systems. The IG requires implementers to support specific profiles and extensions, adhere to cardinality and data type constraints, and use mandated value sets. The use of `Bundle` resources with `Composition` as an index provides a clear structure for organizing and navigating the complex data set. The IG also provides guidance on handling partial dates, edit flags, and indicating "none of the above" for groups of observations.

## Ecosystem Context

The primary target systems for this IG are EHRs, health information exchanges, and vital records systems at the state and national level. The intended users include clinicians, hospital staff, vital records registrars, and public health officials. The IG builds upon US Core and the Vital Records Common Library, and it is related to other IGs like the Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) IG. It is designed to support birth and fetal death reporting in the United States, under the auspices of the NCHS and state vital records offices. The primary use cases include the electronic submission of birth and fetal death reports from healthcare providers to vital records offices, and the subsequent exchange of coded data with NCHS for statistical and public health purposes. The IG also supports the exchange of coded demographic data, including race and ethnicity, between NCHS and vital records offices.
