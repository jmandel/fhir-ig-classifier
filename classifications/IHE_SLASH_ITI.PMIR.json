It does not use CDA, v2, or v3, focusing solely on a FHIR-based approach. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, it does leverage other IHE profiles that might use different standards, thus showing some awareness of a broader HL7 ecosystem.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on establishing a centralized patient identity registry. Therefore, EHR systems, as primary sources and consumers of patient data, are crucial. Systems involved in patient registration, such as civil registration and vital statistics systems, will also play a significant role. While not directly involved in managing patient identities, systems that consume patient data, like lab and pharmacy systems, will need to integrate with the registry to ensure they are working with the correct patient. Public health systems may also benefit from a unified patient identity for population-level analysis. Research platforms might utilize the registry for de-identification or linking research data to clinical records. Payer systems have minimal involvement, primarily needing to ensure correct patient identification for claims processing. PHR systems are not directly addressed but could potentially benefit from a consistent patient identity.",
