It also references the Belgian eHealth platform and national medication coding systems. Therefore, it is classified as a National Implementation Guide for Belgium.",

It primarily addresses the Clinical Data domain, with a strong emphasis on representing patient allergies accurately and consistently. It also touches upon Administrative aspects by involving patient and practitioner information, and has implications for Workflow by facilitating the sharing of allergy data between different healthcare providers. While it mentions potential use in clinical studies, the Research domain is not a primary focus.",

It primarily targets EHR systems for recording and sharing allergy data. Pharmacy systems are also key players for medication allergy checks. Clinical Decision Support systems will leverage this data for alerts, and PHR systems will allow patients to view and potentially contribute to their allergy records. Public health and research platforms may utilize this data in an aggregated, anonymized manner. Payer systems are not directly involved, and imaging/lab systems have minimal interaction.",
