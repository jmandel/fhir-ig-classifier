# extensions: Analysis

1.  **Objective and Context:** This IG aims to define a set of common extensions to the HL7 FHIR standard for use within the European REALM. In simple terms, it provides standardized ways to add extra information to FHIR resources that are commonly needed in European healthcare settings, ensuring interoperability. It's for anyone implementing FHIR in Europe.

2.  **Improvements:** The IG doesn't explicitly state improvements over previous approaches within the provided files. However, it implicitly improves by providing a defined set of extensions, which facilitates consistent data representation and exchange within the European context. The IG also provides specific packages for different FHIR versions (R4 and R4B), catering to different implementation needs.

3.  **Key Features and Approaches:**
    *   **Extensions:** The core feature is the definition of several extensions for FHIR resources, including:
        *   `CompositionBasedOnOrderOrRequisition`: Links a document to its originating order or requisition.
        *   `InformationRecipient`: Specifies the intended recipient of a composition.
        *   `MedicationDevice`, `MedicationStrengthSubstance`, `MedicationStrengthType`, `MedicationClassification`, `MedicationProductName`, `MedicationSizeOfItem`, `MedicationCharacteristic`, `MedicationUnitOfPresentation`: Extensions related to medication information.
    *   **Context Definition:** Extensions are associated with specific FHIR resources or elements using the `context` property.
    *   **RuleSets:** Common rules for extensions, value sets, and sections are defined using RuleSets for reusability.
    *   **Value Sets:** The IG utilizes existing value sets (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT) and defines its own.
    *   **NPM Packages:** The IG is distributed as an NPM package, allowing easy integration into FHIR projects.
    *   **Multiple Formats:** Definitions and examples are provided in XML, JSON, and TTL formats.

4.  **Relationship to Broader Standards:** The IG builds upon the HL7 FHIR standard. It specifically mentions several external code systems like LOINC, SNOMED CT, ATC, and others. It also references the IPS (International Patient Summary) profiles, aligning with broader efforts in international health data exchange. It also references IHE profiles for medication.

5.  **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**
    *   **Implementers:** The primary users are developers and implementers of FHIR systems in Europe who need to exchange healthcare data.
    *   **Healthcare Providers:** The IG helps standardize data exchange between healthcare providers, improving interoperability.
    *   **Patients:** Indirectly, patients benefit from improved data exchange and interoperability, leading to better care coordination.
