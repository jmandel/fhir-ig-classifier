# ITI.BasicAudit: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to define reusable patterns for AuditEvent resources in healthcare settings. It provides a foundation for logging security and privacy-related events, particularly within IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) environments, where interoperability is key. The goal is to standardize how audit logs are created, allowing for easier analysis and correlation across different systems. It focuses on basic patterns for RESTful operations, security tokens (SAML and OAuth), consent-based authorization decisions, and privacy disclosures. This IG provides a base for more specific audit event profiles.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG provides a more structured and FHIR-compliant approach to audit logging compared to previous methods. It moves from DICOM AuditMessage to FHIR AuditEvent, and defines profiles using FHIR StructureDefinitions with examples. It also addresses specific security token use-cases, such as SAML and OAuth, with different levels of detail (opaque, minimal, comprehensive). It moves away from the free-form tables that were previously used, and instead uses a structured approach with profiles and examples. It emphasizes the importance of including patient context in audit logs where applicable, and addresses the need for minimal vs. comprehensive logging based on the environment in which the data is used.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    -   **Reusable AuditEvent Profiles:** Defines base profiles for common RESTful operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Query), security token usage (SAML, OAuth), consent-based authorization decisions, and privacy disclosures.
    -   **Slicing:** Uses FHIR slicing to define different agent types and entities within the AuditEvent resource.
    -   **Minimal vs. Comprehensive Logging:** Offers options for minimal logging (preserving identifiers only) or comprehensive logging (including more details from security tokens and other sources).
    -   **Patient Context:** Emphasizes the inclusion of Patient references when the audit event is related to a specific patient.
    -   **X-Request-Id Handling:** Provides structured approach for recording the X-Request-Id header in AuditEvents.
    -   **Security Token Support:** Provides specific profiles for use with SAML and OAuth tokens, including handling of opaque tokens.
    -   **Use of CodeSystems and ValueSets:** Defines specific codesystems and valuesets for agent types and other elements within the AuditEvent,
    -   **CapabilityStatements:** Includes CapabilityStatements defining the capabilities for the Audit Creator, Consumer, and Repository actors.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG builds on IHE's ATNA profile for transport and query/retrieval of AuditEvents. It aims to provide a FHIR-based approach for audit logging that aligns with standards used in IHE profiles. The IG also addresses privacy concerns by defining best practices for recording patient information, and provides ways to report disclosures of patient data. The use of security tokens and consent-based authorization decision aligns with security standards used in healthcare.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are developers and implementers building systems that need to comply with IHE profiles. These systems include applications, services, and infrastructure within a healthcare environment that need to record audit logs. The beneficiaries include:
    -   **System Administrators and Security Officers:** They can use the audit logs for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance verification.
    -   **Privacy Officers:** They can use the audit logs to track disclosures of patient data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
    -   **Healthcare Providers:** They can use the audit logs to track data access and usage within the healthcare system.
    -   **Patients:** They indirectly benefit from the improved security and privacy of their data through better audit logging practices. Patients may also benefit from being able to request accounting of disclosures.
