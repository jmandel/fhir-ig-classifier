It defines a standardized method for requesting and retrieving PDMP history, leveraging FHIR resources and operations. The core purpose is to improve patient safety and combat drug misuse by providing prescribers and pharmacists with access to a patient's controlled substance prescription history. While it touches upon administrative aspects like identifying providers and organizations, its primary focus is on medication-related data and facilitating a specific workflow for PDMP data retrieval.",

Public health agencies and government agencies also have a significant stake, as the IG supports their goals of monitoring drug misuse and ensuring compliance with regulations. Payers have a minimal role, primarily related to payment method information. Patients have an indirect role, as the IG aims to improve their safety.
