  "rationale": "The ITI.sIPS Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining how the HL7 FHIR International Patient Summary (IPS) is communicated using IHE Document Sharing profiles. The IG specifies the use of FHIR as the standard for representing the IPS content and details the mapping of IPS elements to Document Sharing metadata. \n\nThe core functionality of this IG revolves around enabling the exchange of IPS documents through established IHE Document Sharing mechanisms like XDS, XCA, XDM, XDR, MHD, and MHDS. It defines how the FHIR-based IPS content is encapsulated within these frameworks, ensuring interoperability across different systems and settings. The IG also addresses the use of \"On-Demand\" document entries, allowing for dynamic generation of IPS documents based on current data. \n\nWhile the IG heavily references the HL7 FHIR IPS specification for the content model, its primary contribution is the specification of how this content is shared using IHE profiles. It provides guidance on populating Document Sharing metadata elements, such as DocumentEntry and SubmissionSet, based on the IPS content. The IG also includes examples of DocumentReference resources for both XML and JSON encodings of IPS documents. \n\nIn essence, the ITI.sIPS IG acts as a bridge between the HL7 FHIR IPS content standard and the IHE Document Sharing infrastructure, facilitating the seamless exchange of patient summaries in a standardized and interoperable manner. It does not define new clinical content or workflows but rather focuses on the technical aspects of data exchange and metadata mapping.",
