  "rationale": "The \"v2-to-fhir\" Implementation Guide focuses on defining mappings between HL7 Version 2 messages, segments, data types, and vocabulary to their corresponding FHIR R4 Bundle, resources, data types, and coding systems. It does not specify mappings for clinical care, public health, or research domains. Instead, it provides a technical framework for converting v2 data into FHIR format. The guide includes mappings for messages, segments, data types, and coding systems, with a focus on defining how v2 elements should be represented in FHIR. It also includes implementation considerations, validation guidelines, and test conversions. The guide is intended for a global audience, as indicated by the jurisdiction \"001\" (World). The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, who are responsible for implementing the v2-to-FHIR transformations. The guide also acknowledges contributions from various individuals and organizations involved in its development. The guide is marked as \"active\" and is currently in ballot status, indicating that it is under review and subject to change. The guide's primary purpose is to facilitate data exchange between v2 and FHIR systems by providing a standardized set of mappings. It does not focus on data modeling for specific clinical domains or use cases, but rather on the technical aspects of data transformation. The guide also includes mappings for vocabulary, indicating a focus on representing clinical knowledge in a standardized way. The guide does not define specific workflows or security mechanisms, but it does provide implementation considerations related to these topics.",
