It leverages FHIR Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses to structure and transmit this data, aiming to improve data quality, timeliness, and efficiency compared to manual reporting. While it touches upon administrative aspects like patient demographics and care location, its core purpose revolves around public health surveillance and quality reporting related to HAIs in the LTCF setting.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on streamlining the electronic submission of Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) data from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The design is driven by the needs of Public Health Agencies (specifically the CDC's NHSN) to collect standardized, high-quality data for surveillance and quality improvement. Clinical Care Teams within LTCFs, particularly infection preventionists, are key users responsible for data entry and submission. Government Agencies have a significant role in setting the reporting requirements and overseeing the program. While other groups like Healthcare Administrators and Research Organizations may benefit from the data, their influence on the IG's design is less direct.",
