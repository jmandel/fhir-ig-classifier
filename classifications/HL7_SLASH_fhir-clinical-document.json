  "rationale": "The \"fhir-clinical-document\" Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining a standardized representation of clinical documents within the FHIR framework. It establishes a canonical structure for FHIR-based clinical documents, drawing heavily from the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard. \n\nThe IG specifies a `ClinicalDocumentBundle` profile, which is a FHIR Bundle of type \"document\" containing a `ClinicalDocumentComposition` as its first entry. This Composition acts as an index and contains key header information, similar to a CDA header. The IG also defines extensions for elements like `data-enterer`, `informant`, `information-recipient`, `participant`, `consent`, and `order`, which map to corresponding CDA header components. \n\nFurthermore, the IG addresses document succession management, outlining how to handle document replacement and addenda using the `Composition.relatesTo` element. It also provides guidance on human readability and rendering of FHIR Clinical Documents, emphasizing the importance of deterministic rendering of attested narrative content. \n\nWhile the IG references other FHIR specifications and IGs (like the International Patient Summary and C-CDA on FHIR), its core function is to define a new, standardized way to represent clinical documents in FHIR. It does not define specific clinical workflows or decision support logic but rather provides the foundational structure for exchanging clinical documents in a consistent and interoperable manner. The IG also includes an operation definition for converting a FHIR Clinical Document into a FHIR transaction bundle, indicating a focus on data exchange mechanisms. The IG is intended for a universal realm, although it does acknowledge and build upon existing work from various national jurisdictions, particularly the US (C-CDA on FHIR).",
