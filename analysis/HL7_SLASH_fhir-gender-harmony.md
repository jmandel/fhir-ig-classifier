# fhir-gender-harmony: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to standardize the representation of sex and gender information in healthcare systems. It seeks to address the current inconsistent and often conflated use of "sex" and "gender" by providing clear, distinct data elements and structures for gender identity, sex parameters for clinical use, recorded sex or gender, name to use, and pronouns. The context is broad, encompassing various healthcare settings and use cases where accurate and respectful representation of this information is crucial. The intended users are healthcare providers, IT system vendors, researchers, and standards developers.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG improves upon previous approaches by moving beyond a single, often ambiguous "administrative sex" field. It introduces specific data elements and structures for:
    *   **Gender Identity:** Allows for self-identified gender beyond a binary.
    *   **Sex Parameter for Clinical Use (SPCU):** Provides context-specific guidance on how to apply sex-related parameters for clinical activities, replacing a single "clinical sex" value.
    *   **Recorded Sex or Gender:** Captures the source and context of recorded sex or gender information, acknowledging its potential divergence from current identity or clinical parameters.
    *   **Name to Use:** Acknowledges and supports the use of a person's preferred name, not only their legal name.
    *   **Pronouns:** Allows for the documentation of a person's preferred pronouns.
    It also harmonizes terminology and data element definitions across FHIR, CDA, and HL7v2, allowing for consistent data exchange between systems.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features and technical approaches of this IG include:
    *   **FHIR Extensions:** Utilizes FHIR extensions to add the new data elements to existing resources, allowing for flexibility and backwards compatibility.
    *   **Value Sets:** Defines a minimum set of values for gender identity, pronouns and sex parameter for clinical use that are extensible to allow for jurisdictional and community specific values. The value sets are maintained by HL7 at terminology.hl7.org.
    *   **Cross-Paradigm Approach:** Provides guidance for FHIR, CDA, and HL7v2, aiming for consistent implementation of the model across different standards.
    *   **Contextual Specificity:** Emphasizes the context-specific nature of Sex Parameter for Clinical Use (SPCU), linking it to clinical observations and activities.
    *   **Clear Definitions:** Provides clear definitions for each element, including usage notes and terminology bindings.
    *   **Examples:** Provides examples for FHIR, CDA and HL7v2 of how to use these new constructs to support better patient care.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG recognizes the need to align with standards and regulations. It acknowledges the existing use of "Administrative Sex" in HL7v2, while providing a more precise way of representing sex and gender information. The guide also references the US Core implementation guide and NCPDP standards. The guide also notes that it is aligning with the DICOM supplement 233. It specifies the use of LOINC codes to represent the observations.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users and beneficiaries of this IG include:
    *   **HIT System Solution Providers:** Vendors of EHR and other healthcare IT systems, who need to implement and support these data elements.
    *   **Healthcare Providers:** Clinicians and other care providers, who will use the data to improve patient care and communication.
    *   **Researchers:** Researchers, who will use the data for health disparities analysis, and other research.
     *   **Standards Development Organizations (SDO):** Messaging and interchange standards developers and standardized terminology organizations who play a role in implementing guidance around distinguishing, capturing, and sharing gender and sex information.
	* **Government/Regulatory:** Regulatory, legal and research organizations who have a vested interest in a consistent approach to documenting sex, gender and related information
    *   **Patients:** Directly benefit from more accurate and respectful representation of their gender identity and other sex and gender related information in their health records.
