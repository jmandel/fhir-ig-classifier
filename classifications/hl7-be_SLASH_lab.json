It heavily emphasizes the representation of diagnostic data, particularly lab results, using FHIR resources like `DiagnosticReport`, `Observation`, and `Specimen`. While it touches upon administrative aspects through patient and provider identification, its core purpose revolves around ensuring consistent and interoperable exchange of laboratory data to improve care coordination and patient safety. It also has implications for public health reporting and research by providing a standardized format for laboratory data.",
