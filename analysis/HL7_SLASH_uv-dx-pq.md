# uv-dx-pq: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG (uv-dx-pq) aims to standardize the representation of pharmaceutical quality data related to analytical procedures for drug products and substances. It provides a structured way to represent information typically found in Common Technical Document (CTD) Module 3, specifically sections 3.2.P.5 (Control of Drug Product) and 3.2.S.4 (Control of Drug Substance). This allows for easier viewing, sharing, and processing of this data, primarily targeting those involved in pharmaceutical quality documentation and regulatory submissions.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing a structured, machine-readable format (using FHIR) for analytical procedure data. This contrasts with traditional methods, as represented by the PDF examples, which are primarily human-readable and difficult to process computationally. The IG enables the representation of data such as test methods, sample preparation, acceptance criteria, and the relationship between resources such as substances, products, devices, and procedures using FHIR resources like PlanDefinition, ObservationDefinition, SubstanceDefinition, SpecimenDefinition, and DeviceDefinition.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** The key features of this IG include:
    -   Use of FHIR resources like `PlanDefinition`, `ObservationDefinition`, `SubstanceDefinition`, `SpecimenDefinition`, and `DeviceDefinition` to represent analytical procedure data.
    -   The use of profiles to define specific structure and constraints on these resources for the pharmaceutical quality domain.
    -   A focus on representing data related to both drug products and drug substances.
    -   The ability to include process parameters and qualified values (acceptance criteria) within the test definitions.
    -   The use of extensions to add domain specific information to the core FHIR resources.
    -   The ability to link related resources together using `reference` fields.
    -   The use of code systems to provide standardized terminologies.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG relates to broader healthcare standards and regulations by targeting the structured representation of information within the CTD, a globally recognized format for pharmaceutical regulatory submissions. By using FHIR, this IG aligns with broader efforts to promote interoperability and data exchange in healthcare, while specifically addressing the needs of the pharmaceutical industry in a regulatory context.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users of this IG are those involved in creating, managing, and reviewing pharmaceutical quality documentation, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and potentially software developers creating tools for managing this data. This IG is designed for the industry and regulatory agencies and does not have direct benefit to patients.
