# fhircast-docs: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to enable real-time synchronization of user interfaces across different healthcare applications. It allows applications to display the same clinical context and content to a user simultaneously. The context is a shared workspace, like a user's login session across multiple applications or a shared view of one application distributed to multiple users. The goal is to improve clinician workflows by ensuring consistent information is presented across disparate systems.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing a standardized, lightweight, and more implementer-friendly method for context synchronization compared to older standards like CCOW. It uses a simple JSON wrapper around FHIR resources for communication, which is easier to implement. It leverages WebSockets for real-time event notifications and recommends SMART on FHIR for session discovery and authentication, which provides a more secure and standardized way to manage sessions. It also introduces a versioning system for shared content to maintain consistency between applications.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features and technical approaches include:
    *   **WebSockets for real-time communication:** Uses WebSockets for pushing event notifications to subscribers.
    *   **FHIR resources for data exchange:** Uses FHIR resources to represent context and shared content.
    *   **SMART on FHIR for session discovery and authentication:** Recommends SMART on FHIR for secure application launch and session information exchange.
    *   **Hub-and-spoke architecture:** Uses a central Hub to manage subscriptions and distribute events.
    *   **Event-driven model:** Defines a set of workflow events (e.g., Patient-open, DiagnosticReport-update) that trigger context changes and content updates.
    *   **Content Sharing Mechanism:** Defines a transactional approach to sharing content by using `Bundle` resources in update events with `PUT` and `DELETE` operations.
    *   **`versionId` for content consistency:** The Hub assigns and maintains a `context.versionId` for the anchor context's content to avoid lost updates and out-of-sync conditions.
    *   **`select` events for content selection:**  Introduces `select` events to indicate which resources are selected within a context.
    *   **Well-known endpoint:**  A `.well-known/fhircast-configuration` endpoint exposes the Hub's supported events and other capabilities as a JSON document.
    *   **FHIR CapabilityStatement Extension:** FHIR servers can declare support for FHIRcast and its hub location using a FHIR CapabilityStatement extension.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG builds upon FHIR, which is a foundational healthcare interoperability standard. It leverages SMART on FHIR for authentication and authorization, which is a widely adopted security framework within the FHIR ecosystem. By using JSON for data exchange, it aligns with modern web development standards. It aims to facilitate the secure exchange of patient data in a manner that adheres to common healthcare interoperability principles. The IG also provides profiles for FHIR resources used in FHIRcast events, ensuring consistent usage and data exchange.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users and beneficiaries are:
    *   **Clinicians:**  By providing real-time synchronized context across applications, it aims to improve workflow efficiency and reduce errors.
    *   **Healthcare application developers:** The IG provides a standardized method for implementing context synchronization and content sharing, reducing the need for bespoke integrations.
    *   **Healthcare organizations:**  It enables seamless integration between different systems, leading to better data accessibility and improved workflows.
    *   **Indirectly, patients:**  By improving the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare workflows, patients ultimately benefit through better care.
