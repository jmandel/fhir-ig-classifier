It does not use CDA or v2, and while it acknowledges v3 concepts like RxNorm, it doesn't deeply integrate them. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it leverages other FHIR-based IGs, but not in the sense of bridging FHIR with other HL7 standards like CDA or v2.",

While it touches upon administrative aspects through insurance plan representation and has implications for medication management, its core purpose is to provide transparent access to formulary information, impacting payment and financial aspects related to prescription drug costs.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on defining a RESTful API for accessing drug formulary information. It heavily relies on Data Profiles to model the formulary data using InsurancePlan, Basic, and MedicationKnowledge resources, along with custom extensions. Terminology plays a crucial role in identifying drugs (RxNorm) and categorizing formulary-related concepts. REST APIs are the core mechanism for data access, with specific search parameters defined for common queries. While not a primary focus, Services are implied through the use of custom search parameters. Other aspects like Decision Support, Documents, Forms & UI, Messaging, and Subscriptions are not significantly addressed in this IG.",
