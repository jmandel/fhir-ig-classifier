    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide defines a framework for representing electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) using FHIR resources, CQL, and QI-Core profiles. It heavily relies on data profiles for `Measure` and `Library` resources, terminology for defining value sets, and decision support through CQL-based logic. REST APIs are used for operations like packaging measures, but the core focus is on defining the structure and content of eCQMs rather than specific API interactions. Messaging, documents, forms, and subscriptions are not central to this IG's purpose.",
