It does not directly utilize or reference CDA, v2, or v3, focusing solely on FHIR resources and interactions. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and potential future connections to other IGs suggest a moderate level of cross-paradigm awareness.",

While developed with cooperation from US agencies (ONC and FHA) and intended to align with US-specific standards like US Core, it does not explicitly state that it is governed by or primarily designed for the US. It mentions broad applicability and potential adaptation to specific jurisdictional requirements, but the core content does not enforce US-specific rules or regulations. Therefore, it is best classified as 'Universal Realm' with some US influence.",
