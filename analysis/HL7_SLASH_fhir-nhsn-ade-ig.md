# fhir-nhsn-ade-ig: Analysis

1.  **Objectives and Context:**

    This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize how hospitals electronically report data on inpatient hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (low and high blood sugar) to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This is part of a broader effort to improve patient safety by tracking and benchmarking these adverse drug events (ADEs) nationwide.

    **In simple terms:** It creates a standard way for hospitals to send data about patients' blood sugar levels and related medications to the CDC, so they can track and analyze these events to improve patient care and safety.

2.  **Improvements over Previous Approaches:**

    The IG leverages NHSN's experience with HL7 standards and builds upon a 10-year partnership with HL7 and EHR vendors. This suggests a move towards a more standardized and collaborative approach to ADE reporting compared to potentially less structured or consistent methods used previously. The IG also explicitly aims for EHR and vendor neutrality, promoting wider adoption and interoperability. 

3.  **Key Features and Technical Approaches:**

    *   **Focus:** The IG specifically addresses inpatient hypo- and hyperglycemia, excluding outpatient events.
    *   **Data Elements:** It focuses on linked data from electronic medication administration records (eMAR), laboratory blood glucose results, and diabetes diagnoses.
    *   **FHIR Standard:** It utilizes the HL7 FHIR standard for data exchange, specifically the Composition resource to package patient-level data.
    *   **Calculations:** The IG outlines how the NHSN will use the reported data to calculate various metrics related to hypo- and hyperglycemia rates and severity.
    *   **NQF Alignment:** The metrics are aligned with existing National Quality Forum (NQF) quality measures for hypo- and hyperglycemia. 

4.  **Relationship to Broader Standards and Regulations:**

    *   **HL7 FHIR:** The IG is built upon the HL7 FHIR standard, a widely recognized standard for healthcare data exchange.
    *   **NQF Measures:** It aligns with and supports reporting for established NQF quality measures, indicating its relevance to national quality improvement efforts.
    *   **NHSN Reporting:** The IG is designed to enable reporting to the NHSN, a national system for healthcare-associated infections and other adverse events, highlighting its role in public health surveillance.

5.  **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**

    *   **Hospitals:** The IG primarily targets hospitals as the entities responsible for reporting data to the NHSN.
    *   **NHSN/CDC:** The CDC and NHSN benefit from standardized data collection for analysis, benchmarking, and public health surveillance.
    *   **Quality Improvement Professionals:** The data and metrics enable quality improvement efforts within hospitals to reduce hypo- and hyperglycemia rates.
    *   **EHR Vendors:** EHR vendors will need to implement the IG's specifications to facilitate data reporting for their hospital clients.
    *   **Patients:** Ultimately, patients benefit from improved patient safety and quality of care resulting from reduced rates of hypo- and hyperglycemia.
