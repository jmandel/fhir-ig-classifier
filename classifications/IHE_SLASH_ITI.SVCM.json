  "rationale": "The ITI.SVCM Implementation Guide defines a lightweight interface for healthcare systems to retrieve centrally managed uniform nomenclature and mappings between code systems based on the HL7 FHIR standard. It focuses on defining FHIR-based transactions for querying, expanding, validating, and translating terminology resources like ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps. \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines seven transactions: Query Value Set (ITI-95), Query Code System (ITI-96), Expand Value Set (ITI-97), Lookup Code (ITI-98), Validate Code (ITI-99), Query Concept Map (ITI-100), and Translate Code (ITI-101). These transactions utilize FHIR search and operations on the ValueSet, CodeSystem, and ConceptMap resources. The IG also defines profiles on these resources, specifying constraints and usage expectations within the SVCM context. Additionally, it outlines security considerations, requiring the Terminology Repository to be grouped with an ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application. The IG provides capability statements for both the Terminology Consumer and Terminology Repository actors, detailing the supported interactions and search parameters. Finally, it includes several examples of the defined transactions and resource profiles, demonstrating their practical application.",
