# genomics-reporting: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the representation and exchange of genomic information within healthcare systems. It provides a framework for creating, sharing, and interpreting genomic reports, including variant analysis, pharmacogenomics (PGx), oncology findings, and HLA typing. The IG targets stakeholders involved in genomic testing and reporting, such as laboratories, clinicians, researchers, and electronic health record (EHR) vendors.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

- **Structured Data:** The IG promotes the use of structured data elements for genomic information, enabling interoperability and computational analysis, as opposed to relying primarily on free-text narratives.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** It supports a wide range of genomic reporting scenarios, including somatic and germline variants, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and pharmacogenomic implications.
- **Standardized Terminology:** The IG leverages established coding systems like LOINC, HGVS, and Sequence Ontology, ensuring consistent terminology and facilitating data aggregation and research.
- **Clinical Decision Support:** It includes profiles for therapeutic and diagnostic implications, enabling the integration of genomic findings into clinical decision support systems.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Genomic Report:** The core resource for representing genomic findings, including variants, interpretations, and recommendations.
- **Variant, Haplotype, and Genotype:** Profiles for representing specific genomic variations and their relationships.
- **MolecularBiomarker:** A generic profile for representing various biomarkers, including TMB and MSI.
- **Therapeutic and Diagnostic Implications:** Profiles for linking genomic findings to potential clinical impacts.
- **Medication Recommendation:** A Task resource for recommending medication adjustments based on genomic information.
- **GenomicStudy:** A resource for capturing structured metadata about genomic studies and analyses.
- **FHIR Operations:** Defines operations for querying and retrieving genomic data, enhancing data accessibility and interoperability.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

- **HL7:** Aligns with the HL7 FHIR standard, promoting interoperability within healthcare systems.
- **LOINC, HGVS, Sequence Ontology:** Uses established coding systems recognized by regulatory bodies and standards organizations.
- **CAP/CLIA:** Supports adherence to laboratory quality assurance guidelines.
- **ClinicalTrials.gov:** Enables linking genomic findings to relevant clinical trials.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Laboratories:** Standardizes genomic reporting formats, facilitating data exchange with clinicians and researchers.
- **Clinicians:** Provides structured genomic data for informed decision-making, including medication prescribing and diagnosis.
- **Researchers:** Enables data aggregation and analysis for genomic research and discovery.
- **EHR Vendors:** Offers a framework for integrating genomic information into EHR systems, enhancing patient care.
- **Patients:** Ultimately benefits patients by enabling personalized medicine approaches based on their genomic information.
