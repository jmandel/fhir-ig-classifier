  "rationale": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining standards and specifications for routing FHIR exchanges through intermediaries. It establishes a model where intermediaries can act as \"inbound gateways\" or \"delegated intermediaries\" to facilitate communication between originating systems and destination systems. The IG emphasizes a \"passive\" intermediary approach, where the intermediary forwards requests and responses without altering them, and the originating system may be unaware of the intermediary's presence. \n\nThe IG specifies how destination systems should use their public FHIR service base URLs, how intermediaries should handle routing and exceptions, and the security considerations for such exchanges. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous interactions and provides detailed scenarios for each. The IG also outlines the roles of different actors, including originators, destinations, and intermediaries, and defines the responsibilities of each. \n\nKey aspects defined by this IG include:\n\n1.  **FHIR RESTful Capabilities:** Specifies that intermediaries and destination servers must support JSON and should support XML.\n2.  **Security:** Mandates conformance with FHIR security guidelines and allows for the implementation of UDAP security. It emphasizes a \"pass-through\" security model where trust is established between the originator and destination.\n3.  **Exception Handling:** Defines how intermediaries should handle and report exceptions, including passing through HTTP status codes from the destination or generating their own for intermediary-specific issues.\n4.  **FHIR Service Base URLs:** Specifies how destinations should structure and use their public FHIR service base URLs and how intermediaries should handle routing based on these URLs.\n5.  **Synchronous and Asynchronous Scenarios:** Provides detailed steps for routing requests and responses through intermediaries in both synchronous and asynchronous interactions.\n6.  **Trust:** Defines that trust is negotiated between the originator and destination, with intermediaries playing a passive role.\n\nThis IG does not define specific clinical data models or profiles but focuses on the infrastructure and mechanisms for enabling interoperability in a complex healthcare ecosystem with intermediaries.",
