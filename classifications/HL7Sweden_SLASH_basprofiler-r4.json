  "rationale": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines base profiles and extensions for use within the Swedish healthcare context. It is based on FHIR R4 and focuses primarily on data modeling, defining how core FHIR resources should be structured and constrained for use in Sweden. \n\nThe IG establishes profiles for key resources like Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, and Organization, specifying required and recommended elements, value sets, and extensions. For example, the Patient profile includes specific identifiers used in Sweden (personnummer, samordningsnummer, nationelltReservnummer), defines how to represent marital status using a combination of HL7 and Swedish-specific codes, and introduces an extension for official address types. The Practitioner profile defines slices for identifiers like HSA-ID, prescriber code, and legitimation, and specifies value sets for occupational codes. The Organization profile includes slices for HSA-ID and organization identifier, and references a value set for organization types.\n\nAdditionally, the IG defines several extensions, such as SEBaseMiddleNameExtension and SEBaseOwnFamilyExtension for use within the HumanName profile, and SEBaseAddressPersonExtension for specifying official address types. It also defines value sets for concepts like marital status, address types, and various occupational codes, often combining international standards with Swedish-specific code systems.\n\nThe IG's primary purpose is to provide a common foundation for FHIR implementations in Sweden, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different systems and use cases. While it touches on data exchange by defining identifiers and specifying how resources should be structured, its main focus is on defining the data models themselves. The IG is intended for a wide range of stakeholders, including technical implementers like EHR vendors and system integrators, as well as healthcare provider organizations and public health agencies.",
