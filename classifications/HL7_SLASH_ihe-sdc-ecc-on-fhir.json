    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally built upon FHIR to represent IHE SDC forms, particularly for electronic Cancer Protocols (eCPs). It leverages FHIR resources like Observation, DiagnosticReport, and DocumentReference for data representation and exchange. While it acknowledges IHE SDC, which is based on HL7 v3, the IG itself doesn't directly utilize v3 or CDA. It does not use v2. It demonstrates a degree of cross-paradigm integration by bridging IHE SDC with FHIR.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on representing and exchanging data from IHE Structured Data Capture (SDC) forms, specifically electronic Cancer Protocols (eCPs), using FHIR resources. It leverages `Observation`, `DiagnosticReport`, and `DocumentReference` to capture and transmit structured clinical data, primarily for cancer reporting. While it touches upon quality measurement and public health reporting, its core purpose is the structured representation and exchange of clinical data captured in eCPs. The IG also addresses the workflow of extracting data from SDC forms and mapping it to FHIR, and it includes considerations for identity and security through the use of standard FHIR resources.",
