The \"Lite\" profiles suggest a focus on streamlined workflows and basic data exchange, rather than complex clinical scenarios. Identity and security are implicitly addressed through the use of standard FHIR security mechanisms and the focus on Swedish-specific identifiers.

It defines core profiles and extensions for resources like Patient, Practitioner, Organization, and ServiceRequest, tailored for Swedish-specific identifiers and terminology. The primary systems involved are EHRs, which need to fully implement the IG to ensure interoperability. Other systems like PHR and Pharmacy systems have limited but clear integration requirements, mainly for patient identification and medication-related data exchange. Public Health systems may leverage the standardized data for population health monitoring, while Research Platforms could utilize it for data collection and analysis.

Clinical Care Teams are the core users, as the IG directly impacts their ability to access and share patient information, manage referrals, and coordinate care. Healthcare Administrators also have a significant role, as the IG aims to reduce administrative burdens and improve data quality. While Patients and Caregivers are not directly interacting with the IG, they benefit from improved care coordination and potentially easier access to services like self-referrals. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations have a limited role, potentially using the standardized data for population health analysis and research, respectively. Payers are not directly addressed, and Government Agencies have a minimal role, primarily in setting the context for the IG's development within the Swedish healthcare system.",
