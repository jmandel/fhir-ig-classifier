    "summary": "The ITI DSUBm Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, utilizing its RESTful approach and resource definitions. It heavily relies on FHIR's subscription mechanism, extended from the R5 Backport IG. While it acknowledges and integrates with document sharing environments like XDS, it does not directly utilize CDA, v2, or v3 standards. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges FHIR with existing document sharing paradigms, but not in the sense of directly integrating different HL7 standards within the IG itself.",
