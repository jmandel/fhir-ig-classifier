# FHIR-us-pq-cmc-fda: Analysis

1.  **Objectives:** This IG aims to standardize the representation of pharmaceutical quality (PQ) and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data related to drug products and substances using FHIR. It focuses on data needed for regulatory submissions, such as those to the US FDA. The IG's goal is to facilitate the electronic exchange and interoperability of this complex information, primarily within the context of eCTD (electronic Common Technical Document) submissions. This is intended for regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies.

2.  **Improvements:** This IG provides a structured, standardized approach to represent PQ and CMC data using FHIR. Previous approaches likely involved less standardized methods, potentially relying on varied document formats and proprietary data structures. The IG introduces specific profiles and data elements for drug substances, drug products, excipients, batch formulas, and quality specifications, providing a more precise and interoperable way to exchange this information.

3.  **Key Features and Technical Approaches:**
    *   **Profiles:** The IG defines numerous profiles, including `CodedOrganization`, `DrugProductIngredient`, `SubstanceDefinitionHandle`, `ExcipientRaw`, `QualitySpecification`, `DrugProductwithImpurities`, `BatchFormulaMedicinalProduct`, `BatchFormula`, `EctdComposition32P55`, `CMCeCTDDocument32P55`, `StructureReference`, `DrugProductHandle`, `DrugProductDescription`, `ContainerClosure`, `BatchAnalysis`, `EctdCompositionSP4151`, `CMCeCTDDocumentSP4151`, `FinishedProduct`, `DrugSubstanceBatch`, `ResultObservation`, and `MultipleReplicatesResultObservation`. These profiles provide a structured framework for representing various types of PQ/CMC data.
    *   **Extensions:** Several extensions are defined to handle specific data elements related to batch formulas, container closure, and quality control, such as `ProductBatchIngredientExtension`, `ProductBatchStrengthTextualExtension`, `AmountRatio`, `ContainerClosureExtension`, `ApprovalStatus`, `targetRange`, `overagePercent`, and `overageJustification`.
    *   **Code Systems and Value Sets:** The IG leverages existing code systems like NCIT, UNII, UCUM, and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, and also defines custom value sets, like `PqcmcContainerTypeTerminology`, `PqcmcClosureTypeTerminology`, `PqcmcUnitsMeasure`, `PqcmcPercentageUnits`, `PqcmcProductPartType`, `PqcmcReleaseProfile`, `PqcmcReleaseMechanism`, `PqcmcCapsuleClassificationCategory`, `PqcmcDrugProductComponentFunctionCategoryTerminology`, `PqcmcExcipientFunctionTerminology`, `PqcmcProductPartIngredientPhysicalLocation`, `PqcmcQualityBenchmarkTerminology`, `SplPharmaceuticalDosageFormTerminology`, `SplDrugRouteofAdministrationTerminology`, `PqcmcNamePartTerminology`, `PqcmcBatchUtilizationTerminology`, `PqcmcStrengthTypeTerminology`, `PqcmcImpurityClassificationTerminology`, `PqcmcAnalyticalInstrumentDataFileTypes`, `PqcmcNonPercentageUnits`, `cmc-product-name-types-vs`, and `cmc-comp-section-types-vs` to ensure consistent coding of data.
    *   **RuleSets:** The IG uses RuleSets such as `DUNSandFEINumber`, `AdditionalInformationProperty`, `ProductPartIdentifierProperty`, `ProductPartIdentifierReferenceProperty`, `DosageForm`, `RouteOfAdministration`, and `ProprietaryAndNonProprietaryNames` to promote reusability and consistency in profile definitions.
    *   **Invariants:** Invariants are defined to enforce data quality and consistency, such as `org-length9`, `org-length7`, `addr-state`, and `addr-zip`.
    *   **Examples:** The IG includes various examples of FHIR resources, showcasing how the profiles are intended to be used.

4.  **Relationship to Broader Standards and Regulations:** This IG is explicitly designed to support the exchange of pharmaceutical quality (PQ) and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data, particularly within the context of regulatory submissions to the US FDA, aligning with eCTD requirements. It uses established standards like FHIR, NCIT, UNII, UCUM, and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, promoting interoperability with other healthcare standards. The IG is intended to support the FDA's electronic submission requirements.

5.  **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**
    *   **Pharmaceutical Companies:** These companies will use the IG to structure and format their CMC data for regulatory submissions, potentially streamlining their processes and improving the clarity and accuracy of their filings.
    *   **Regulatory Agencies (e.g., FDA):** The FDA will be a primary beneficiary, as the standardized approach will facilitate the review and analysis of submissions, enhance data quality, and potentially speed up the regulatory process.
    *   **Patients (indirectly):** Patients benefit indirectly through the increased efficiency and improved quality of the drug approval process, potentially leading to quicker access to safer and more effective medications.
