It heavily relies on FHIR and its ecosystem, including US Core and Bulk Data Access, while not directly utilizing other HL7 standards like CDA, v2, or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is present in a limited sense, primarily through the use of FHIR to represent data that might traditionally be handled by other standards.",
