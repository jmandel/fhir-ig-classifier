It heavily utilizes Data Profiles and Extensions to achieve this, along with custom Services (Operations) for form population, extraction, and assembly. Terminology plays a crucial role in coding questions and answers. While REST APIs are implicitly used for resource interactions, the IG's focus is more on the custom operations. Forms & UI aspects are addressed through rendering extensions, but detailed UI specifications are not the primary focus. Decision Support is present in the form of FHIRPath expressions for enabling logic and calculations, but it's not a core driver. Messaging and Documents are not central to the IG's purpose.
