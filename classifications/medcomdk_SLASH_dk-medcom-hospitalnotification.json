It heavily relies on FHIR for its core structure and data representation, with no mention or use of CDA, v2, or v3. While it uses FHIR messaging, it doesn't explicitly integrate with other HL7 paradigms, making the Cross-Paradigm score low.",

It leverages FHIR R4 and builds upon core profiles and extensions to define a message-based exchange of essential information related to patient admission, leave, and discharge. While it touches upon clinical data through the Encounter resource, its primary driver is the administrative and workflow aspects of coordinating care between different healthcare settings.",

Clinical Care Teams in both hospitals and municipalities are the core users, driving the design to ensure continuity of care. Healthcare Administrators in these organizations also have a significant influence, as they manage the systems involved. Public Health Agencies have a defined but limited role, potentially using aggregated data for monitoring. Government Agencies have a minimal role, primarily related to the regulation and oversight of the Danish healthcare system and MedCom. Patients, Payers, and Research Organizations are not meaningfully involved in this specific IG.",
