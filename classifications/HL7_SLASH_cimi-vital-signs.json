Clinical Care Teams are the core users, as they rely on accurate and detailed vital signs data for patient care. Researchers also heavily benefit from the standardized data for analysis. Public Health Agencies can leverage this data for population health monitoring. While Patients and Caregivers may interact with systems using this IG, their influence on its design is less direct. Payers and Healthcare Administrators have a limited role, primarily in ensuring compliance and data exchange. Government Agencies have a minimal role, mainly related to oversight and potential future regulations.",
