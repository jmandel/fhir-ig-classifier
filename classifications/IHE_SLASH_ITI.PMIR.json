  "rationale": "The ITI.PMIR FHIR IG focuses on managing patient identities across healthcare systems, aligning it with the Infrastructure & Foundational domain. It leverages the FHIR R4 standard, specifically using resources like Patient and RelatedPerson. Its primary purpose is to standardize data exchange and workflow related to patient identity. While it has international applicability (Universal Realm), the analysis highlights its relevance in LMICs. The IG does not specify a primary data source but implies a mixed approach, potentially involving EHRs and other systems. It does not mention a formal balloting or approval status, suggesting a Draft/Trial Use maturity level.",
