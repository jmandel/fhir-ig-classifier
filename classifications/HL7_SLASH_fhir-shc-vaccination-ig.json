While Clinical Care Teams might indirectly benefit, the IG is primarily driven by the need for verifiable health status in various public and private settings. Public Health Agencies have a significant stake in the standardization and use of this data for population health management. Patients and Caregivers are key users as they are the subjects of the data and control its presentation. Payers and Research Organizations have minimal involvement.",
