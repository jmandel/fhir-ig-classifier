  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-mdi-ig\" defines a set of resources and guidelines for exchanging information related to medicolegal death investigations (MDI). The core functionality of this IG revolves around defining FHIR profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems to facilitate interoperability between MDI case management systems, forensic toxicology labs, and electronic death registration systems (EDRS). \n\n**Functional Domain:** The IG primarily focuses on **Clinical Care** and **Public Health**, with a strong emphasis on data exchange to support death investigations, which have implications for both domains. It also touches upon **Administrative & Financial** aspects through its support for workflows like death certificate review and cremation clearance. The IG defines several profiles related to death certificates, forensic toxicology, and administrative reports, indicating a focus on specific clinical and public health use cases. While it references research standards, it does not define any artifacts specifically for research purposes.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The IG is explicitly based on **FHIR R4** and defines numerous FHIR profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems. It does not define any resources related to CDA, v2, or v3, nor does it specify any cross-paradigm functionality.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The primary purpose of this IG is **Data Modeling**, as it defines numerous profiles that constrain existing FHIR resources for the MDI domain. It also has a strong focus on **Data Exchange**, specifying how these profiles should be used in document and message bundles for interoperability. The IG defines capability statements for different actors, outlining the expected interactions and operations. While it includes some information on workflows, the main focus is on data modeling and exchange mechanisms. The IG also defines extensions and value sets related to security and privacy, but these are not its primary focus.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** The IG is explicitly stated to be a **US Realm Specification**, and the jurisdiction is specified as the United States of America. It references US Core and includes examples with US addresses and organizations. It does not define any resources or examples specific to other national jurisdictions or regions.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The IG is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including **Healthcare Provider Organizations** (specifically clinical care teams involved in death investigations), **Public Health Organizations** (such as agencies and surveillance teams), **Technical Implementers** (like EHR vendors and system integrators), and **Administrative Organizations** (involved in death certificate processing). It also indirectly impacts **Patient-Facing Stakeholders** through its support for death investigation and reporting processes.",
