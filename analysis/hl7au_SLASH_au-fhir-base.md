# au-fhir-base: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The "HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide: AU Base" aims to standardize the representation of healthcare data in Australia using the FHIR standard. It defines Australian-specific concepts, extensions, and terminology to facilitate consistent data exchange between healthcare systems within the country. The IG targets implementers, developers, and healthcare providers in Australia seeking to adopt FHIR.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The IG explicitly states its intention to improve upon previous approaches by:

- **Harmonizing data representation:** It encourages the use of AU Base-defined concepts instead of local redefinitions, promoting consistency across different healthcare domains.
- **Reducing integration complexity:** Aligning with AU Base simplifies data exchange between systems adhering to various implementation guides, minimizing the need for extensive translations.
- **Providing a base for future specifications:** AU Base acts as a foundation for more specific use-case implementation guides like AU Core, fostering interoperability and a common understanding of Australian healthcare data in FHIR.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Extensibility:** The IG primarily defines base profiles, avoiding strict cardinality constraints or mandatory binding strengths. This allows for flexibility and adaptation in different implementation scenarios.
- **Terminology Localization:** It introduces Australian-specific value sets and code systems, enabling the representation of local concepts like Medicare card numbers, DVA entitlements, and indigenous status.
- **Identifier Standardization:** It provides profiles for common Australian business identifiers, promoting consistent identification of entities across systems and formats.
- **Alignment with International Standards:** AU Base references and considers international standards like the HL7 Gender Harmony IG and specifications like International Patient Access and International Patient Summary, ensuring compatibility and broader interoperability.

## 4. Relationship to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

- **FHIR Standard:** AU Base builds upon the foundation of the HL7 FHIR standard, extending its capabilities for the Australian context.
- **National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS):** The IG leverages and references NCTS terminology resources, aligning with national standards for healthcare data representation.
- **Australian Digital Health Agency:** The IG defines namespaces for HPI-O and ABN scoped identifiers published by the Agency, promoting the use of nationally recognized identification mechanisms.
- **AHPRA Data:** AU Base provides specific guidance on representing data sourced from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), ensuring consistency in exchanging practitioner information.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Implementers and Developers:** They use the IG to understand and implement FHIR in Australian healthcare systems, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
- **Healthcare Providers:** They benefit from standardized data exchange, enabling seamless information sharing across different care settings.
- **Patients:** Ultimately, patients benefit from improved healthcare coordination and communication facilitated by standardized data exchange. AU Base's support for representing concepts like Name to Use, Pronouns, Gender Identity, and Sex Assigned at Birth contributes to a more inclusive and patient-centered approach.
