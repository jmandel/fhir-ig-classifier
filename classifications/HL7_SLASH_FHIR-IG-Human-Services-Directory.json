  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"FHIR-IG-Human-Services-Directory\" defines a standard for representing and exchanging data related to human services directories. It focuses on creating FHIR profiles and resources to model organizations, locations, and services within the context of social care. \n\nSpecifically, this IG defines three core profiles: HSDOrganization, HSDLocation, and HSDHealthcareService. These profiles are aligned with the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Provider Directory Implementation Guide but are tailored to the specific needs of human services directories. The IG also defines search parameters to enable querying these resources based on various criteria, such as name, address, service type, and program. \n\nFurthermore, the IG provides a mapping between the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) and the defined FHIR profiles. This mapping facilitates the implementation of FHIR-based access to human services directories for organizations that are familiar with the HSDS model. The IG also includes example instances of the defined profiles to demonstrate their usage. \n\nIn terms of scope, the IG primarily focuses on data modeling and exchange, defining the structure of the data and the mechanisms for querying it. It does not delve into workflow support or knowledge representation, although it does touch upon security and privacy considerations. The IG is intended for use within the United States, as indicated by its alignment with US Core and the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Provider Directory Implementation Guide. \n\nThe primary stakeholders for this IG are technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, who are responsible for implementing FHIR-based access to human services directories. Healthcare provider organizations, public health organizations, and administrative organizations may also benefit from this IG, as it enables them to access and utilize human services directory data within their workflows. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is currently in STU (Standards for Trial Use) 1 status.",
