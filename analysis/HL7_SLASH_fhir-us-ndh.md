# fhir-us-ndh: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to create a National Directory of Health (NDH) providers and services. It provides a standardized way to represent and exchange information about healthcare providers, organizations, locations, services, and insurance networks. The context is the need for a comprehensive and interoperable directory of healthcare resources within the US. This directory is intended to be used by various stakeholders to discover and access healthcare information.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG introduces new profiles, extensions, code systems, and value sets to represent healthcare directory data in a structured and interoperable format. It also defines specific search parameters for efficient querying of the directory. It provides explicit structures for representing relationships between resources (e.g., practitioner and organization, location and service), and includes new elements to represent concepts like verification status and delivery methods. The IG focuses on defining a National Directory of Healthcare Providers & Services with added security elements (trust frameworks) and business use cases. It also includes specific elements for identifying the kind of resource being published (e.g. attestation server, etc.)

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **Profiles:** Defines custom profiles for FHIR resources like `Organization`, `Location`, `Practitioner`, `HealthcareService`, `Endpoint`, `CareTeam`, `InsurancePlan`, `OrganizationAffiliation`, `PractitionerRole`, `Restriction`, and `VerificationResult`.
    *   **Extensions:** Introduces custom extensions for representing additional information such as `accessibility`, `associatedServers`, `deliveryMethod`, `digitalCertificate`, `endpointUseCases`, `fundingSource`, `identifierStatus`, `networkReference`, `newPatients`, `orgAliasType`, `orgAliasPeriod`, `orgDescription`, `paymentAccepted`, `practitionerQualification`, `rating`, `requiredDocument`, `restrictFhirPath`, `secureExchangeArtifacts`, `trustFramework`, `usageRestriction`, `verificationStatus`, and `viaIntermediary`. It also includes extensions to support more complex data like `contactpoint-availabletime`, `endpoint-testing-certification`, `dynamicRegistration`, and `serviceOrProgramRequirement`.
    *   **Code Systems and Value Sets:** Defines custom code systems and value sets for concepts like `AcceptingPatients`, `Accessibility`, `CredentialStatus`, `ConsentScope`, `ConsentPolicyRules`, `ConsentCategory`, `DigitalcertificateUse`, `DeliveryMethod`, `EmploymentStatus`, `AgeGroup`, `InsuranceStatus`, `EndpointAccessControlMechanism`, `EndpointConnectionType`, `EndpointTestingMethod`, `HealthcareServiceCategory`, `HealthcareServiceRatingType`, `HealthcareServiceReferralMethod`, `IgActor`, `NdhEndpointEnvironment`, `NdhDirectTrustPayloadType`, `NdhFhirEndpointUseCase`, `NdhDirectTrustEndpointUsecase`, `InsuranceProductType`, `InsurancePlanType`, `OrgType`, `OrgAliasType`, `OrganizationAffiliationRole`, `OrganizationAffiliationRoleForHie`, `PractitionerRole`, `QualificationStatus`, `VirtualModalities`, `NdhTrustFrameworkType`, `NdhPayerCharacteristics`, `NdhSecureExchangeArtifacts`, `NdhAssociatedServersType`, `TrustProfile`, `NdhVerificationCommunicationMethod`, `NdhVerificationProcess`, `NdhVerificationStatus`, and more.
    *   **Search Parameters:** Defines custom search parameters for efficient querying of resources based on various criteria.
    *   **Bundles:** Utilizes Bundles to group resources for transactions and collections.
    *   **Capability Statements:** Describes the expected capabilities of NDH server implementations.
    *   **Restrictions:** Introduces a `Restriction` resource that can be used to govern the use of other resources based on configurable rules.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds on the HL7 FHIR standard and US Core profiles, providing a more specific implementation for national healthcare directory purposes. It incorporates terminologies from NUCC (National Uniform Claim Committee) for provider taxonomies, LOINC for care team categories, and other relevant code systems. The IG also includes concepts related to security such as trust frameworks, certificate handling, and usage restrictions, that are relevant to regulatory compliance in the US healthcare system. The IG also includes elements to support exchange of information between payers, providers and patients.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    *   **Healthcare Providers:** To publish and manage their information in a standardized way.
    *   **Organizations:** To publish and manage organization information, services, and network participation.
    *   **Payers:** To publish and manage network information, insurance plans, and coverage details.
    *   **HIEs/HINs:** To facilitate the exchange of provider and organization information.
    *   **Application Developers:** To build applications that can consume and utilize healthcare directory data.
    *   **Patients:** Indirectly benefit from this IG as it enhances the ability to find and access information about healthcare providers, services, and networks. However, they are not direct users of the directory itself.
    *   **Federal and State Government Agencies:** To facilitate provider data exchange and management.
