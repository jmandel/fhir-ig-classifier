It heavily relies on FHIR's RESTful API and resources, particularly the Asynchronous Request Pattern. It does not use or reference HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. While it doesn't explicitly integrate across different HL7 paradigms, it does leverage other standards like NDJSON and SMART on FHIR in conjunction with FHIR, which could be considered a form of cross-paradigm integration within the broader HL7 ecosystem.",

Its design is driven by the needs of developers building systems that need to consume or produce large FHIR datasets. While clinical care teams and patients may indirectly benefit, the IG's direct users are primarily technical stakeholders. Public health agencies and research organizations are also key beneficiaries due to their need for large-scale data analysis. Payers and healthcare administrators may utilize the IG for tasks like quality measure calculation and claims data integration. Government agencies have a minimal role, primarily related to potential oversight of data sharing practices.",
