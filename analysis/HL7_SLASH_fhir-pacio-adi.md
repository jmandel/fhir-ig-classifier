# fhir-pacio-adi: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to enable the interoperable exchange of advance directive information (ADI) using FHIR standards. It focuses on representing an individual's goals, preferences, and priorities for medical treatment and interventions when they cannot communicate for themselves due to a health crisis. The context is the need for seamless access to this information across different healthcare settings and systems, addressing issues like transitions of care, especially for aging populations. The IG targets various users, including patients, care providers, and healthcare IT system developers.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing a standardized, digital way to represent and exchange ADI, including scanned documents, CDA, and native FHIR documents. It allows for the creation, sharing, query/access, and verification of this information via RESTful APIs. It addresses the limitations of paper-based or siloed digital documents by enabling a more efficient, secure, and interoperable way to manage and access advance directive information. It also aims to represent the different types of ADI: Person-Authored, Encounter-Centric, and Portable Medical Orders.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include the use of FHIR profiles for resources like `Composition`, `DocumentReference`, `Observation`, `Consent`, `CarePlan`, `ServiceRequest`, and `RelatedPerson`. The IG defines three content types for ADI: Person-Authored Advance Directive Information, Encounter-Centric Patient Instructions, and Portable Medical Orders. It requires the use of the `DocumentReference` resource for indexing documents, the use of `Bundle` resources for FHIR native documents, and supports digital signatures for non-repudiation. It also uses extensions for document versioning, clauses, and other specific ADI concepts. The IG specifies the use of detached signatures where the signature is saved in a separate Binary resource and referenced by a DocumentReference. It also provides search parameters for efficient retrieval of ADI.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is based on the HL7 FHIR R4 standard and builds on the US Core Implementation Guide. It also aligns with HL7 CDA standards for representing CDA documents. It specifies the use of standard terminologies like LOINC, SNOMED CT, and HL7 codes for representing concepts. It addresses privacy and security aspects by recommending the use of TLS, SMART on FHIR, and data sharing policies using the `Consent` resource. It also references the FHIR Security guidance and the FHIR Implementerâ€™s Safety Checklist.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users and beneficiaries include:
    *   **Patients:** They benefit from having their advance directives digitally represented, easily shared, and accessible across different care settings and systems. They can also control who has access to their ADI.
    *   **Care Providers:** They benefit by having access to patients' advance directives in a standardized and readily accessible format, enabling informed and person-centered care decisions.
    *   **Healthcare IT system developers:** They can use this IG to implement systems that support the interoperable exchange of ADI, including creation, sharing, query, access, and verification.
    *   **Payers, Providers, and Quality Reporting Agencies:** They can use the IG to support better care coordination and reporting.
    *   **Business analysts and policy managers:** They can use the IG to inform policy decisions and strategic planning.
