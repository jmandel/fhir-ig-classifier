# ch-epr-term: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The CH EPR Term FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize terminology used in the Swiss electronic patient record (EPR) system. It defines a common set of codes, value sets, and concept maps for key healthcare concepts, ensuring interoperability and consistent data exchange within the Swiss healthcare ecosystem. This IG specifically focuses on terminology for core profiles, exchange formats, and the Swiss EPR, facilitating seamless communication and data sharing among various healthcare stakeholders.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

While the provided files do not explicitly detail previous approaches, the IG's emphasis on FHIR-based terminology, aligning with international standards like SNOMED CT, suggests a shift towards a more modern, interoperable, and machine-readable approach compared to potential legacy systems.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

The IG utilizes FHIR resources like CodeSystem, ValueSet, ConceptMap, and NamingSystem to define and structure the terminology. It leverages SNOMED CT as a primary reference terminology and incorporates codes from other systems like EDQM. The IG provides translations for key concepts in multiple Swiss languages (German, French, Italian, Romansh), ensuring accessibility and understanding for diverse users.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The IG directly supports the Swiss EPR FDHA Ordinance, which mandates the use of specific metadata in the Swiss EPR. It aligns with international FHIR standards, promoting interoperability beyond the Swiss context. The inclusion of terminologies from established organizations like SNOMED CT and EDQM demonstrates adherence to recognized healthcare standards.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

The primary users of this IG are healthcare professionals, system developers, and organizations involved in the Swiss EPR ecosystem. By standardizing terminology, the IG ultimately benefits patients by enabling accurate and consistent recording and exchange of their health information, leading to improved care coordination and patient safety.
