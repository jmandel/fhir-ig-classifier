# HAI-LTCF: Analysis

1. **Objectives:** 
This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize how Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) electronically report Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), a system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It defines a way for electronic health record systems to send HAI data to NHSN in a structured format. This is important for public health surveillance, tracking infection trends, and improving infection prevention in LTCFs.

2. **Improvements over previous approaches:**
The IG enables electronic submission of HAI data from LTCFs, which previously relied on paper forms and manual web entry. This is expected to reduce the burden on reporters, improve efficiency, minimize data errors, and enhance data quality for national benchmarks and infection prevention efforts. 

3. **Key features and technical approaches:**
- Uses FHIR Questionnaires to structure HAI data, mirroring the format of existing NHSN forms.
- Leverages the FHIR RESTful API for data exchange.
- Relies on the US Core Patient profile for exchanging patient information and utilizes ValueSets from the Value Set Authoring Center (VSAC) for standardized terminology.
- Defines specific FHIR profiles for Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses related to HAI reporting in LTCFs.

4. **Relationship to broader healthcare standards and regulations:**
- Aligns with the HL7 CDA implementation guide for HAI reporting, ensuring consistency across different standards.
- Depends on the US Core FHIR standard for patient data exchange, promoting interoperability with other US healthcare systems.
- Adheres to NHSN data collection protocols and requirements, supporting national public health surveillance efforts.
- Addresses data privacy concerns by acknowledging the protection of NHSN data under the Public Health Service Act.

5. **Primary users and beneficiaries:**
- **Software developers:** who need to build systems capable of electronically submitting HAI data from LTCFs to NHSN.
- **LTCFs:** who can use this standard to streamline their HAI reporting process and improve data accuracy.
- **CDC and public health agencies:** who can use the standardized data for surveillance, analysis, and infection prevention initiatives.
- **Ultimately, patients:** benefit from improved infection control and prevention efforts in LTCFs, leading to better health outcomes.
