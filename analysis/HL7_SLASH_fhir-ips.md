# fhir-ips: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The FHIR International Patient Summary (fhir-ips) Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the representation of essential patient health information for use in unplanned, cross-border care. It uses the HL7 FHIR standard to define a minimal, yet clinically relevant dataset that can be exchanged between healthcare providers in different countries.

**In simpler terms:** fhir-ips creates a common language for sharing basic patient data across borders, particularly in emergency situations.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

- **Transition to FHIR:** fhir-ips leverages the HL7 FHIR standard, a modern, web-based approach for healthcare data exchange, improving upon the older CDA R2 standard.
- **SNOMED CT Integration:** fhir-ips promotes the use of SNOMED CT, a comprehensive clinical terminology, for enhanced semantic interoperability and translation capabilities.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** The IG uses open slicing to allow for extensions and adaptations beyond the minimal dataset, catering to local and regional needs.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Bundle and Composition:** The core structure of an IPS document is a FHIR `Bundle` containing a `Composition` resource, which organizes the patient information into sections.
- **Profiling:** fhir-ips defines profiles for various FHIR resources, constraining them to meet the specific requirements of the IPS dataset.
- **Value Sets and Code Systems:** The IG leverages standardized terminologies like LOINC, UCUM, and SNOMED CT through value sets and code systems to ensure consistent data representation.
- **Data Absent Reason:** The IG provides mechanisms to handle missing data using the `data-absent-reason` extension, ensuring data completeness and clarity.
- **Operations:** fhir-ips defines operations like `$summary` and `$docref` for generating and accessing IPS documents.

## 4. Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations

- **ISO 27269:** fhir-ips directly implements the ISO 27269 standard, which defines the requirements for an International Patient Summary.
- **Privacy and Security:** The IG acknowledges the sensitive nature of patient data and encourages the use of security labels and privacy consent mechanisms as defined in other FHIR IGs like "Data Segmentation for Privacy."
- **Interoperability Initiatives:** fhir-ips aligns with broader interoperability initiatives like IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) and national adaptations of the IPS.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Healthcare Providers:** Clinicians in different countries can access essential patient information during unplanned care encounters, improving patient safety and care coordination.
- **Patients:** Patients benefit from improved continuity of care when traveling abroad, as their critical health information can be readily shared with healthcare providers.
- **Healthcare System Implementers:** Developers and IT professionals use the IG to build systems that can create, exchange, and consume IPS documents.
- **Standards Development Organizations:** fhir-ips contributes to the global harmonization of healthcare data exchange by leveraging and extending existing standards like FHIR and SNOMED CT.
