  "rationale": "The fhir-sirb Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining a set of FHIR Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses to facilitate the exchange of information between research sites and a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB). The core functionality revolves around creating standardized forms for various aspects of clinical research studies, including study initiation, protocol details, consent forms, recruitment materials, adverse event reporting, and continuing review. These forms are designed to be rendered, completed, transmitted, and stored using FHIR infrastructure, specifically leveraging the Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources. The IG also specifies the use of numerous extensions from the Structured Data Capture (SDC) IG to enable features like form pre-population, display logic, and choice restriction. While the IG mentions the optional use of the ResearchStudy resource, its primary focus is on the Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources. The IG also defines a set of custom codes for use within the Questionnaires when existing HL7 codesystems are insufficient. The IG emphasizes the use of RESTful interactions for exchanging these resources and provides guidance on search parameters. The IG is designed to support the \"NIH Policy on the Use of a Single Institutional Review Board for Multi-Site Research\" and is intended for use in the United States, although it could potentially be adapted for other regions. The primary stakeholders are clinical care teams involved in research, EHR vendors who will implement the IG, and public health organizations involved in oversight of research studies.",
