    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on FHIR, using it as the core framework for representing and exchanging clinical practice guidelines. It heavily relies on FHIR resources, operations, and the Clinical Quality Language (CQL). While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it doesn't directly integrate or depend on them. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the use of CQL with FHIR, but not with other HL7 standards like v2, v3, or CDA.",

It leverages core FHIR resources and operations, defines specific profiles and extensions, and uses CQL for expressing clinical logic. While it mentions applicability to any jurisdiction using clinical practice guidelines and references some US initiatives, it does not explicitly state a primary focus on any specific country or region. Therefore, it is best classified as a Universal Realm guide.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on representing and executing clinical practice guidelines in a computable format. It leverages FHIR resources like PlanDefinition, ActivityDefinition, and Library, along with CQL, to define guideline logic, recommendations, and workflows. The primary goal is to support evidence-based decision-making, quality measurement, and care coordination through standardized, machine-readable guidelines. Therefore, Clinical Knowledge is the core domain, with strong emphasis on Care Planning and Clinical Data to support the guideline execution. Workflow is also important for process coordination, and Quality & Reporting is supported through the integration with quality measures.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on representing and executing clinical practice guidelines in a computable format. It heavily relies on Data Profiles to define the structure of guidelines, recommendations, and related artifacts. Decision Support is a core component, utilizing CQL within Libraries to define eligibility criteria and decision logic. Terminology is important for defining controlled vocabularies used throughout the IG. REST APIs are used, particularly through operations like `$apply` on `PlanDefinition` and `ActivityDefinition`, and `$evaluate` on `Library`. While Forms & UI are present through `Questionnaire`, they are not central to the IG's core purpose. Messaging and Documents are not prominent in this IG. Subscriptions are not explicitly mentioned and are likely not a significant part of the implementation.",

    "summary": "This IG focuses on computable clinical practice guidelines, primarily impacting EHRs and Clinical Decision Support systems. EHRs will need to integrate the guideline execution and data collection aspects, while CDS systems will be crucial for implementing the logic and recommendations. PHR systems have a minimal role, mainly in potentially displaying patient-specific care plans derived from the guidelines. Payer systems might use the quality measures defined in the IG, giving them a limited role. Pharmacy, Lab, and Imaging systems have minimal direct involvement. Public Health systems could leverage the guidelines for population-level analysis and reporting, resulting in a limited role. Research platforms will be important for developing and evaluating the guidelines, as well as for generating evidence based on their implementation.",
