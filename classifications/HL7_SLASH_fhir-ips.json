While it acknowledges and references the CDA IPS IG, it does not directly utilize CDA structures or patterns. The IG does not use v2 or v3 messaging or models. It demonstrates cross-paradigm awareness by referencing the CDA IPS IG and the developing FHIR Clinical Documents IG, indicating a consideration for interoperability across different HL7 approaches.",
