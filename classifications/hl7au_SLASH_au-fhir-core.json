    "summary": "The AU Core Implementation Guide primarily targets software vendors and healthcare providers involved in digital health information exchange within Australia. Clinical Care Teams are the core users, as the IG defines how core health information should be recorded and exchanged, directly impacting their workflows. Software vendors building systems for these teams are also core users. Healthcare Administrators have a significant influence, as the IG impacts data management and interoperability within their organizations. Government Agencies have a significant role in setting standards and regulations, influencing the IG's development. Payers and Public Health Agencies have specific needs related to claims processing and population health monitoring, respectively, that are addressed by the IG. Patients and Caregivers have a defined but limited role, primarily related to data access and communication preferences. Research Organizations have minimal involvement, as the IG focuses on core clinical data exchange rather than research-specific data.",
