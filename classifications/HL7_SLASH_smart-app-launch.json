It heavily leverages OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for security and authorization, which are not HL7 standards but are crucial to its operation. The IG does not utilize CDA, v2, or v3, focusing solely on the FHIR RESTful paradigm. While it doesn't integrate across different HL7 paradigms, it does bridge the gap between FHIR and external security standards.",
