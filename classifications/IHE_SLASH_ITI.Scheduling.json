  "rationale": "The IHE ITI Scheduling Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining FHIR-based mechanisms for accessing and booking appointments. It specifies four main transactions: Find Potential Appointments [ITI-115], Hold Appointment [ITI-116], Book Appointment [ITI-117], and Find Existing Appointments [ITI-118]. These transactions utilize FHIR operations and define specific parameters for searching, holding, booking, and retrieving appointment information. The IG also defines profiles for the Appointment resource and a Bundle resource used in responses. It specifies CapabilityStatements for both client and server actors, outlining the required and optional search parameters and operations. Additionally, it includes security considerations, mandating the use of ATNA and recommending IUA or SMART-on-FHIR for user authentication. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for international use, referencing the Universal Realm jurisdiction. It defines new actors (Scheduling Client and Scheduling Server) and transactions within the IHE framework. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers (like EHR vendors and system integrators) and healthcare provider organizations, particularly their clinical care and IT teams. The IG's core purpose is to standardize data exchange and workflow support related to appointment scheduling, with a strong emphasis on data modeling through the defined profiles and operation definitions.",
