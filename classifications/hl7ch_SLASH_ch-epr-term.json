It heavily emphasizes the use of Code Systems, Value Sets, and Concept Maps to ensure consistent coding across various systems and exchange formats. While it touches upon clinical data related to vaccinations and allergies, its core purpose is terminology management, making Clinical Data and Medications important but not the central focus. Administrative aspects are present in the form of canton abbreviations and guarantor information, but they are secondary to the main goal of terminology standardization. Identity & Security, Payment & Financial, and Research are not addressed. Public Health is indirectly supported through standardized vaccination terminology. Quality & Reporting is not a primary focus, but standardized terminology can contribute to it. Workflow is not explicitly defined, but the IG implies the use of terminology resources in various healthcare processes.",
