    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on using FHIR to standardize the representation and exchange of advance directive information. It heavily relies on FHIR's RESTful API and resource model. While it acknowledges CDA and provides guidance for representing CDA-based advance directive documents, it doesn't deeply integrate with CDA's structure or exchange mechanisms. The IG doesn't utilize HL7 v2 or v3 directly, focusing solely on the FHIR paradigm. Cross-paradigm integration is limited to acknowledging and providing a pathway for CDA documents within the FHIR framework.",

Therefore, EHR systems are central to its implementation, as they will be responsible for creating, storing, and sharing these documents. PHR systems will also play a crucial role in enabling patients to create and manage their directives. While not directly involved in processing advance directives, Payer systems might need awareness of their existence for care coordination. Public Health and Research systems have minimal involvement, primarily for aggregated data analysis. Clinical Decision Support systems can leverage advance directives to provide tailored recommendations, and Pharmacy and Lab systems have limited interaction. Imaging systems are not involved.",
