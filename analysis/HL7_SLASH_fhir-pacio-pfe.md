# fhir-pacio-pfe: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the exchange of information about a person's functioning and engagement in their daily life. It focuses on observations related to a person's abilities, the help they need, and contributing factors (physiological, environmental, and personal), particularly in post-acute care (PAC) settings and across the spectrum of care. The objective is to promote better care coordination and support for patients as they transition between settings, such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG consolidates and replaces the previously published PACIO Functional Status, PACIO Cognitive Status, and PACIO SPLASCH IGs. It provides a unified set of profiles for representing functioning observations from various domains, reducing the need for multiple, similar IGs. It also categorizes observations into health domains based on ICF, which facilitates data validation and use in a consistent manner and enables implementers to adopt the IG more consistently to support exchange with minimal partner-specific handling.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   Use of FHIR R4 and US Core profiles as a base.
    *   Definition of abstract and specific profiles for observations related to functioning and engagement, including `PFECollection`, `PFESingleObservation`, `PFEClinicalTestObservation`, and `PFENarrativeHistoryOfStatus`.
    *   Use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to categorize observations into health and health-related domains.
    *   Provision of value sets containing LOINC codes for specific domains, such as mental functions, mobility, and communication.
    *   Use of extensions to capture additional information, such as the location where an observation was made and devices used by patients during assessments.
    *   Support for structured data capture using FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources.
    *   Emphasis on use of the `hasMember` element for collections and the `derivedFrom` element to link observations.
    *   Definition of search parameters for efficient data retrieval.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is designed to support interoperability as required by the IMPACT Act by standardizing the exchange of functioning and engagement data across post-acute care settings. It also aims to align with broader healthcare standards by using FHIR R4, US Core profiles, and internationally recognized terminology standards such as LOINC and ICF. It addresses the need for scalable and meaningful data exchange, which is a challenge in achieving interoperability.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users include:
    *   Healthcare providers and clinicians (physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers) in acute, post-acute, and community settings who need to exchange patient functioning data for care coordination, treatment planning, and tracking progress.
    *   Payers (e.g., CMS) who require standardized assessment data for claims processing and quality measurement.
    *   Patients and their families or caregivers, who benefit from more informed and coordinated care and potentially have access to their data through FHIR-enabled applications.
    *   Software developers implementing systems that support data exchange for functioning and engagement.
