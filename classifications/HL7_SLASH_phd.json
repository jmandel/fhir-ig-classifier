While it acknowledges and maps data from IEEE 11073 standards, it doesn't directly use HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. It does demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by bridging the IEEE 11073 world with FHIR.",

It heavily emphasizes clinical data from PHDs, defining detailed profiles for various observation types. It also touches upon device management and patient identification, but with a focus on facilitating data exchange rather than comprehensive administrative or security features. While it mentions research as a potential use case, the IG's core design is driven by the need to integrate PHD data into clinical workflows.",
