Systems involved in health information exchange, including those that transform or validate CDA documents, also play a key role. While not directly focused on clinical decision support, the ability to represent CDA in FHIR could indirectly benefit CDS systems by enabling easier access to structured clinical data. Similarly, research platforms could leverage this IG to analyze CDA data using FHIR tools. Other system types have minimal or no direct involvement.",
