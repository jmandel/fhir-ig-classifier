  "rationale": "The RTLS IG primarily focuses on defining a standardized way for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) to communicate with other healthcare systems, particularly regarding the enrollment, unenrollment, and location updates of tracked tags. It leverages FHIR messaging to achieve this interoperability. The IG specifies three main event types: Enroll Tag, Unenroll Tag, and Tag Location Update. For each event type, it mandates the use of the FHIR messaging model and defines specific FHIR resource profiles (rtlsMessageBundle, rtlsMessageHeader, rtlsDevice, rtlsLocation) to structure the data being exchanged. While the IG doesn't delve into the specifics of what constitutes an \"updated location,\" it clearly outlines the mechanism for RTLS to notify other systems about such updates. The IG's core contribution lies in establishing a common language and structure for RTLS data exchange, enabling seamless integration between RTLS and other systems like EHRs. It does not define workflows, clinical guidelines, or administrative processes. The IG is geared towards technical implementers, particularly those developing or integrating RTLS and healthcare systems. The IG does not specify a particular geographic scope, but it is implicitly geared towards the US realm as it is an HL7 US Realm IG.",
