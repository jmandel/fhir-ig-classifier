# fhir-udap-security-ig: Analysis

1. **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**

   This IG aims to establish secure and standardized methods for healthcare applications to access and exchange data. It focuses on extending OAuth 2.0 with Unified Data Access Profiles (UDAP) workflows for both consumer-facing apps and business-to-business (B2B) applications. The context is the growing need for interoperability in the healthcare ecosystem, particularly for FHIR-based data exchange. It provides a framework for client application registration, user authentication, and authorization, making it easier and safer for applications to interact with FHIR servers. The IG is intended for developers of client applications, authorization servers, and resource servers that handle healthcare data.

2. **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**

   This IG builds upon previous UDAP IGs and harmonizes workflows for consumer-facing and B2B applications to facilitate cross-organizational and cross-network interoperability. It introduces a formal definition for a B2B Authorization Extension Object. It emphasizes the use of asymmetric cryptographic keys bound to digital certificates for enhanced security, and it provides a structured approach for communicating metadata crucial for healthcare information exchange.

3. **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**

   - **Dynamic Client Registration:** Automates the process of registering client applications with authorization servers using UDAP workflows.
   - **JWT-Based Client Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) signed with private keys for secure client authentication.
   - **UDAP Metadata:** Defines a standard format for servers to publish their capabilities regarding UDAP workflows, including supported grant types, scopes, and endpoints.
   - **Signed Metadata:** Requires servers to provide signed metadata to ensure the integrity and authenticity of their published capabilities.
   - **Tiered OAuth for User Authentication:** Enables a workflow where the data holder can delegate user authentication to a preferred OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP).
   - **B2B Authorization Extension Object:** Provides a standardized way for B2B client apps using client credentials flow to include information about the requestor and purpose of use in authentication tokens.
   - **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):** Mandates the use of PKCE to enhance the security of the authorization code flow.
   - **Scope Negotiation:** Provides guidance for how client applications and servers should negotiate the scopes granted during registration and access token requests.

4. **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**

   This IG is designed to be compatible with and complementary to the HL7 SMART App Launch Framework. It also aligns with the security model and UDAP workflows outlined in the Carequality FHIR-Based Exchange IG and incorporates UDAP workflows used in IGs published by the CARIN Alliance and the Da Vinci Project. It leverages and extends OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which are widely adopted standards for authorization and authentication.

5. **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**

   - **Client Application Developers:** Benefit from standardized and secure methods for accessing FHIR resources.
   - **Authorization Server and Resource Server Developers:** Benefit from a defined framework for implementing secure authorization and authentication workflows.
   - **Healthcare Organizations:** Benefit from improved interoperability and enhanced security for data exchange.
   - **Patients:** Indirectly benefit from increased data accessibility and potentially improved care coordination facilitated by secure data exchange between applications.
   - **Trust Communities:** Benefit from a framework that facilitates secure and trustworthy data exchange among participants.
