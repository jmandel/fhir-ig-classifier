    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on enabling read-only access to human services directories using FHIR R4. It heavily relies on FHIR for its core structure and functionality, defining profiles and operations based on the FHIR specification. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards like US Core and the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Provider Directory IG, it doesn't directly integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. The IG's primary purpose is to facilitate data exchange using FHIR's RESTful approach, making it a FHIR-centric guide.",

It primarily addresses the administrative aspects of managing and sharing information about organizations, locations, and services related to social determinants of health (SDOH). While it touches upon clinical data through service descriptions and indirectly supports care planning and workflow, its core purpose is to facilitate the exchange of directory information, making it heavily administrative in nature. Identity and security are addressed through privacy considerations, but not with detailed specifications.

Its primary users are Clinical Care Teams who need to refer patients to community resources and Patients and Caregivers seeking these services directly. Payers also have a significant role as they aim to coordinate care and connect members to social services. CBOs are core to this IG as it enables them to make their services discoverable. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations may utilize the standardized data for population health analysis and research, but their needs are less central to the IG's design. Government Agencies have a minimal role, primarily related to oversight and regulation.",
