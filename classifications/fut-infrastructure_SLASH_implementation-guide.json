    "summary": "This Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, defining a comprehensive set of FHIR profiles and extensions for the Danish eHealth Infrastructure. It does not directly utilize HL7 v2 or v3, nor does it focus on CDA, although it mentions integration with IHE XDS.b, which can involve CDA documents. The IG acknowledges other standards like IHE MHD and SDC, indicating some level of cross-paradigm awareness, but the primary focus is on FHIR.",
