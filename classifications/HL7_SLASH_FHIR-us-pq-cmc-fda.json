  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"FHIR-us-pq-cmc-fda\" focuses on the submission of structured information regarding drug product quality, chemistry, manufacturing, and process controls to the US FDA. \n\n**Functional Domain:** This IG primarily deals with the **Administrative & Financial** domain, as it facilitates the submission of drug application data for review, which is an administrative process. It also touches upon the **Research** domain, as the data can be used for regulatory science and research purposes. While the data relates to drug products, the IG itself does not define resources or data exchange mechanisms for direct clinical care, placing it outside the core of the **Clinical Care** domain. The IG does not address **Public Health** concerns such as disease reporting or surveillance.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The IG is explicitly based on **FHIR R5**, as indicated in the `sushi-config.yaml` file. It does not define any elements related to CDA, v2, or v3, nor does it specify any cross-paradigm mappings.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The primary purpose of this IG is **Data Modeling**. It defines numerous FHIR profiles that specify the structure and content of data elements for various aspects of drug product quality, such as drug product description, batch formula, and impurities. While it implicitly supports **Data Exchange** by enabling the submission of this data to the FDA, the IG itself does not define specific APIs or operations for data exchange. It does not focus on **Knowledge Representation** in the sense of clinical guidelines or decision support logic. It does not define **Security & Privacy** mechanisms beyond referencing general HL7 security and privacy guidelines.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** The IG is specifically designed for submissions to the **United States** FDA, as indicated by the `jurisdiction` field in the `sushi-config.yaml` file and the repeated references to FDA requirements. It is not intended for universal or other national jurisdictions.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The primary stakeholders are **Administrative Organizations**, specifically biopharmaceutical companies submitting drug applications to the FDA. **Healthcare Provider Organizations** may be involved in providing some of the data, but they are not the primary users of the IG. **Technical Implementers**, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, will need to implement the profiles defined in the IG. **Standards Organizations** like HL7 and government agencies like the FDA are also key stakeholders. The IG does not directly address **Patient-Facing Stakeholders**.",
