# davinci-deqm: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The Da Vinci Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) Implementation Guide aims to standardize the exchange of clinical quality measure (CQM) data using the HL7 FHIR standard. It focuses on enabling interoperability between healthcare providers (data producers) and payers, registries, or public health agencies (data consumers). The primary goal is to automate and streamline data collection and submission for quality reporting, reducing manual effort and promoting efficient value-based care.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The DEQM IG leverages FHIR's capabilities to improve upon previous approaches like the QDM-CQL-QRDA paradigm. It uses FHIR resources to represent clinical data and the Measure resource for defining CQMs, enabling a more standardized and interoperable approach. The DEQM IG also introduces operations like `$submit-data` and `$collect-data`, simplifying data exchange between systems.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **FHIR-based Data Exchange:** DEQM utilizes FHIR resources and profiles to represent and exchange CQM data, promoting interoperability and standardization.
- **Operations for Data Transactions:** The IG defines operations like `$submit-data`, `$collect-data`, and `$care-gaps` to streamline data exchange and reporting workflows.
- **Support for Incremental and Snapshot Updates:** DEQM allows for both incremental and snapshot updates, providing flexibility for data producers and consumers.
- **Gaps in Care Reporting:** The IG introduces a framework for identifying and reporting care gaps, facilitating quality improvement initiatives.
- **Integration with QI Core and CQFM:** DEQM leverages profiles and guidance from the QI Core and CQFM IGs, ensuring alignment with broader quality measurement standards.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The DEQM IG aligns with several healthcare standards and regulations, including:

- **HL7 FHIR:** The IG is based on the HL7 FHIR standard, promoting interoperability and data exchange in healthcare.
- **Clinical Quality Framework (CQF):** DEQM supports the CQF, a comprehensive approach to quality measurement and reporting.
- **US Core:** DEQM leverages profiles from the US Core IG, ensuring alignment with US healthcare data standards.
- **QRDA Category I and III:** The IG's reporting scenarios align with QRDA Category I (individual) and Category III (summary) reporting specifications.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Healthcare Providers:** Providers benefit from streamlined data submission processes, reducing administrative burden and supporting value-based care initiatives.
- **Payers and Quality Reporting Programs:** Payers and quality programs receive standardized CQM data, facilitating efficient measure evaluation and quality improvement efforts.
- **Patients:** Patients ultimately benefit from improved care quality and outcomes resulting from enhanced data exchange and care gap identification.
- **Public Health Agencies:** Public health agencies can leverage DEQM for data collection and analysis, supporting population health management and reporting.
- **Researchers:** Researchers can utilize DEQM-compliant data for quality improvement studies and analysis.
