  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"uv-dx-pq\" defines a set of FHIR resources and profiles for representing analytical procedures used in the quality control of pharmaceutical products and substances. The primary focus is on data modeling, specifically defining how to structure information about analytical procedures, including the steps involved, the substances used, the devices employed, and the expected results. The IG provides detailed specifications for representing this information using FHIR resources such as PlanDefinition, ObservationDefinition, SubstanceDefinition, SpecimenDefinition, and DeviceDefinition. \n\nThe IG defines a Bundle profile named \"Bundle-analytical-procedure-pq\" to encapsulate the various resources related to an analytical procedure. It also defines profiles for specific resources like PlanDefinition, ObservationDefinition, SubstanceDefinition, and SpecimenDefinition, tailoring them to the specific needs of representing analytical procedures in the pharmaceutical quality domain. The examples provided in the IG, such as \"3.2.P.5.2 Analytical Procedures\" and \"3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures,\" demonstrate how these profiles can be used to represent real-world analytical procedures in a structured and standardized manner. \n\nThe IG primarily targets technical implementers, particularly EHR vendors and system integrators, who are responsible for implementing systems that can capture, store, and exchange pharmaceutical quality data. It also targets healthcare provider organizations, specifically clinical care teams and laboratory systems teams, who need to understand and utilize the standardized representation of analytical procedures. Additionally, the IG is relevant to standards organizations and government agencies involved in defining and regulating pharmaceutical quality standards. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for international use, as indicated by the \"uv\" (universal realm) in its name.",
