  "rationale": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining a set of extensions for use within the European realm. The `sushi-config.yaml` file outlines the IG's metadata, including its canonical URL, title, description, status, version, FHIR version compatibility, and copyright information. It also specifies dependencies and configures parameters for the IG publisher. The `downloads.md` file provides links to download the complete IG, NPM packages, definition files in various formats (XML, JSON, TTL), and examples. The `index.md` file describes the scope of the IG, which is to define common extensions for HL7 FHIR in Europe. The `alias.fsh` file defines aliases for various code systems, value sets, extensions, and profiles used within the IG. The core of the IG's content lies in the `extensions-lab.fsh` and `extensions-mpd.fsh` files, which define specific FHIR extensions. `extensions-lab.fsh` defines extensions related to laboratory reports, such as `CompositionBasedOnOrderOrRequisition` and `InformationRecipient`. `extensions-mpd.fsh` defines extensions related to medication, such as `MedicationDevice`, `MedicationStrengthSubstance`, and `MedicationClassification`. These extensions are designed to enhance the standard FHIR resources with additional data elements specific to European requirements. The `rulesSet-common.fsh` file contains reusable rulesets for defining extensions, sections, and copyright information. Finally, the `Examples.fsh` file provides an example instance of a Composition resource that utilizes the defined extensions.",
