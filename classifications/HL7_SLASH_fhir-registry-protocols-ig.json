While it acknowledges and supports mappings to CDA and HL7 v2 for data source integration, these are secondary to the core FHIR-centric approach. Cross-paradigm integration is present but limited to mapping, not deep integration of different HL7 models.",

It leverages FHIR StructureDefinition to define registry requirements and map them to various data sources (FHIR, CDA, HL7 v2). The IG primarily addresses the workflow of data collection, transformation, and submission, with a strong emphasis on clinical data and its use in quality reporting, research, and public health. While it touches upon administrative aspects through patient identification and submitter information, its core purpose revolves around standardizing and streamlining the process of registry data submission.",
