# fhir-eyecare-ig: Analysis

1. **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
   This IG aims to enable interoperability in ophthalmology by providing a standardized way to represent ophthalmic clinical data using FHIR. The context is the lack of a universal implementation guide for ophthalmology, which hinders data exchange between different systems and prevents advancements in clinical care and research. The IG's objective is to create a comprehensive ophthalmic clinical lexicon in FHIR format, which includes developing use cases, identifying necessary terminologies, and creating a guide for developers. This will allow different ophthalmic systems to exchange data seamlessly.

2. **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
   This IG improves upon previous approaches by addressing the lack of a universal implementation guide for ophthalmology. It provides structured use cases, identifies necessary terminologies from existing clinical vocabularies, and compiles an implementation guide for developers. This IG facilitates data exchange between various real-world electronic medical record (EMR) vendors and fundamental ophthalmic diagnostic device and PACS manufacturers. It also supports real-time data exchange, demonstrated in a connectathon.

3. **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
   Key features include the definition of profiles for ophthalmic observations, diagnoses/conditions, and procedures. It defines specific profiles for ocular anatomical locations, intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and other ophthalmic clinical observations. It also includes profiles for diagnostic reports like visual fields and OCT scans. The IG uses mandatory and must-support elements and defines how consumers and producers should handle these elements. It provides value sets for ophthalmic anatomical locations, observation types, conditions, and procedures. It also defines code systems for additional ophthalmic body structure qualifiers and IOP methods. The approach is collaborative, involving clinical and technical experts, and is iteratively refined through use cases and connectathons.

4. **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
   This IG is built upon the HL7 FHIR standard and interacts with various HL7 Working Groups and Accelerator Programs. It leverages existing medical terminologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD, and CPT. It also acknowledges the input from DICOM and integrates with DICOM-based imaging workflows. This IG seeks community feedback through the formal balloting process. It also aligns with the HL7 Conformance Rules.

5. **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
   The primary users of this IG are developers of ophthalmic software and systems, researchers, clinicians (ophthalmologists and optometrists), and medical device manufacturers. Beneficiaries include patients, who may benefit from improved care, better communication between healthcare providers, and the ability to integrate their health data into personal health record applications. Patients will also benefit from better research outcomes and improved access to new AI-powered diagnostic tools. Payers and accreditation agencies will also benefit from the ability to track outcomes and benchmark performance.
