## 1. Objectives and Context

This Implementation Guide (IG), titled "Da Vinci Unsolicited Notifications Implementation Guide," aims to establish a standardized framework for exchanging real-time healthcare notifications using the FHIR standard. It focuses on enabling providers and payers to send and receive notifications triggered by significant healthcare events, such as patient admissions, transfers, discharges, and changes in treatment or status.

**Context:**

- Addresses challenges in timely information exchange for care coordination and value-based care.
- Responds to the CMS mandate for electronic patient event notifications.
- Builds upon existing FHIR standards like US Core and Da Vinci HRex.

**Target Audience:**

- Healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, post-acute facilities).
- Payers (health plans, insurance companies).
- Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and other intermediaries.
- Technology vendors developing systems for these stakeholders.

**Objectives (in simple terms):**

- Create a common language (using FHIR) for sending healthcare notifications.
- Define a standard way to package and send these notifications.
- Enable seamless communication of patient events between different healthcare systems.
- Improve care coordination, transitions of care, and patient outcomes.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

- **Standardization:** Replaces ad-hoc or proprietary notification mechanisms with a FHIR-based standard, promoting interoperability.
- **FHIR Messaging Paradigm:** Leverages the FHIR messaging framework (e.g., `$process-message` operation) for reliable and consistent notification delivery.
- **Structured Data Exchange:** Uses FHIR resources and profiles to define the content and structure of notifications, ensuring data consistency and meaning.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various notification scenarios beyond admissions and discharges, including transfers and potential future use cases.
- **Alignment with Regulations:** Addresses the CMS mandate for electronic patient event notifications using a standardized approach.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle:** A standardized FHIR Bundle for packaging notification information, including a MessageHeader and related resources (e.g., Encounter, Condition, Coverage).
- **Message Event Codes:** A CodeSystem defining the purpose of the notification (e.g., admission, discharge, transfer).
- **FHIR Profiles:** Constraints and extensions applied to FHIR resources to meet the specific requirements of the notification use case (e.g., Da Vinci Admit/Discharge/Transfer Notification Encounter Profile).
- **`$process-message` Operation:** A FHIR operation for securely transmitting the notification bundle to recipients or intermediaries.
- **Must Support Guidance:** Defines clear expectations for data elements that senders and recipients must be able to handle.
- **Direct ADT Mapping:** Provides mappings between Direct ADT messages (commonly used for V2 ADT) and Da Vinci Notification Bundles, facilitating transition and interoperability.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

- **FHIR:** The IG is built upon the HL7 FHIR standard, promoting interoperability and data exchange within the broader FHIR ecosystem.
- **US Core:** Leverages US Core profiles for common clinical resources, ensuring consistency with national data standards.
- **CMS Regulations:** Directly addresses the CMS mandate for electronic patient event notifications by providing a standardized FHIR-based approach.
- **DirectTrust:** Offers mappings to Direct ADT messages, enabling integration with existing Direct secure messaging infrastructure.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Healthcare Providers:** Receive timely notifications about patient events, enabling better care coordination, transitions of care, and proactive interventions.
- **Payers:** Gain access to real-time patient information, supporting care management, risk adjustment, and quality improvement initiatives.
- **Patients:** Benefit from improved care coordination and communication among their healthcare providers, potentially leading to better health outcomes.
- **HIEs and Intermediaries:** Facilitate the secure and efficient exchange of notifications between providers and payers.
- **Technology Vendors:** Develop FHIR-compliant systems for sending and receiving notifications, contributing to a more interoperable healthcare ecosystem.
