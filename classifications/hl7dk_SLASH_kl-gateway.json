While it acknowledges and utilizes concepts from FSIII, which has roots in v3, the direct use of v3 or CDA is minimal. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges FHIR with the existing Danish healthcare data ecosystem, but not in the sense of directly integrating multiple HL7 paradigms. v2 is not relevant to this IG's purpose.",

The explicit mention of Danish municipalities, the use of Danish-specific terminology (FSIII, FKI), and the focus on reporting to a national gateway (KL Gateway) clearly indicate a national scope within Denmark.",
