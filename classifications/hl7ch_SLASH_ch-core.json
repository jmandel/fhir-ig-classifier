    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide, CH Core, is fundamentally based on FHIR R4 and defines profiles and extensions for the Swiss healthcare system, particularly the Swiss Electronic Patient Record (EPR). It leverages FHIR's RESTful principles and resource model extensively. While it acknowledges and uses some v2/v3 code systems for terminology, it does not directly support v2 messaging or v3 RIM-based models. CDA is not a core component, although the IG defines document profiles that could be used to represent CDA-like documents in a FHIR context. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the use of v2/v3 terminologies within a FHIR framework.",
