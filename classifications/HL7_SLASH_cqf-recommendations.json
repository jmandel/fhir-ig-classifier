  "rationale": "The cqf-recommendations IG focuses on representing and exchanging clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) using FHIR, aiming to improve guideline-based care delivery by integrating CPGs into clinical workflows within EHRs and other health IT systems. This aligns with the 'Clinical Care' domain and 'General Clinical Care' subcategory, as it impacts clinical decision support across various settings. It leverages FHIR R4, specifically using ActivityDefinition, PlanDefinition, and CQL, making 'FHIR' and 'FHIR R4' the applicable standards. Its purpose is to standardize data exchange and support clinical workflows related to CPGs, thus falling under 'Data Exchange' and 'Workflow Support'. The IG doesn't specify a geographic scope, suggesting 'Universal Realm'.  The primary data source is EHRs, where CPGs are integrated, making it 'EHR-Centric'.  The maturity level is not explicitly stated, but the presence of examples and detailed specifications suggests it's beyond 'Draft/Trial Use', hence 'Normative/Standard' is chosen.",
