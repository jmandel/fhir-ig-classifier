  "rationale": "The \"kl-children\" FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining the structure and content for reporting data related to the Danish health promotion and disease prevention program for children. This involves specifying FHIR profiles for various clinical concepts, including Citizen, ParentRelation, Encounter, Location, Indicator, ExamResult, Weight, Height, HeadCircumference, Feeding, Intervention, and QuestionnaireResponse. These profiles are tailored to the specific needs of the Danish program, incorporating constraints and extensions to align with national core profiles and the shared information model (FKI) used in Danish municipalities.\n\nThe IG also defines a set of questionnaires (ADBB, AIMS, EPDS, PUF, SDQ11-17, SDQ4-10, TOPI) used for assessing various aspects of child and parent health. These questionnaires are represented as FHIR Questionnaire resources, with specific link-ids, data types, and value sets defined for each item. The IG emphasizes the importance of validating QuestionnaireResponses against these defined rules, even though the FHIR validator may not fully support this.\n\nFurthermore, the IG specifies a delivery report format using a FHIR Bundle to group and transmit the collected data. This bundle includes instances of the defined profiles and adheres to specific FHIR invariants to ensure data quality and consistency. The IG also provides examples of delivery reports for different scenarios, illustrating how the profiles and questionnaires are used in practice.\n\nIn summary, the \"kl-children\" IG primarily focuses on data modeling and representation, defining the structure and content of the data to be reported. While it touches upon data exchange mechanisms through the delivery report format, the core functionality lies in specifying the profiles, questionnaires, and associated constraints for capturing and representing children's health data within the Danish context.",
