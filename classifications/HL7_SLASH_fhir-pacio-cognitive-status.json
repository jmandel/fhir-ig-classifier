Patient-facing applications (PHRs) will play a role in providing patients and caregivers access to this data. While not the primary focus, Clinical Decision Support systems could leverage this information for alerts and guidance. Public Health and Research Platforms might utilize aggregated, de-identified data for population health analysis and research purposes, respectively.",
