    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (CHMED) is fundamentally based on FHIR to represent the Swiss eMediplan format. It heavily utilizes FHIR resources, profiles, and the document paradigm. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, they are not directly relevant to its core purpose. The IG does not use v2 or v3, and while it could be seen as a bridge between a document-centric approach (like CDA) and FHIR, it does not explicitly support or require CDA. Cross-paradigm integration is minimal, primarily focused on bridging the eMediplan format to FHIR.",

It primarily targets systems involved in medication management, prescription, and patient care within the Swiss healthcare ecosystem. EHR systems are central to implementing this IG, as they will be the primary source and consumer of medication data. Pharmacy systems will also play a crucial role in managing and dispensing medications based on the exchanged information. PHR systems will likely be involved in displaying medication information to patients. Other systems like Clinical Decision Support, Lab, Imaging, Payer, Public Health, and Research Platforms have limited or no direct involvement.",
