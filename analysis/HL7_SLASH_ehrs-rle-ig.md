# ehrs-rle-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to define how Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR-S) should record and manage the lifecycle events of health records. It provides a methodology for trusted EHR and Personal Health Record (PHR) management using FHIR, based on the Record Infrastructure section of ISO/HL7 10781:2023, ISO/HL7 16527:2023, and ISO 21089:2018 standards. It focuses on capturing metadata related to actions taken on health records, including creation, updates, access, and other manipulations, providing a persistent record of these events. The primary context is the management of health data within EHR and PHR systems, ensuring that changes are tracked and auditable.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    The IG leverages FHIR resources (Provenance and AuditEvent) to capture record lifecycle events, which allows for a more standardized and interoperable way of managing and documenting record history. This approach also incorporates W5 metadata (who, what, when, where, why), and it aligns with the ISO/HL7 standards for record management.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   Profiling of the Provenance and AuditEvent FHIR resources to capture record lifecycle event information.
    *   A defined set of Record Lifecycle Events (RLEs) based on the ISO/HL7 10781 standard.
    *   Mapping of RLEs to CRUDE (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions.
    *   Detailed guidance on which data elements (W5 metadata) should be captured for each RLE using FHIR resources.
    *   Use of the AuditEvent resource to capture basic metadata for all RLEs.
    *   Use of the Provenance resource to capture content-related metadata for RLEs that create or update content.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG is explicitly based on and aligns with the following ISO/HL7 standards:
    *   ISO/HL7 10781:2023 Electronic Health Record System Functional Model (EHR-S FM) Release 2.1
    *   ISO/HL7 16527:2023 Personal Health Record System Functional Model (PHR-S FM) Release 2
    *   ISO 21089:2018 Trusted End-to-End Information Flows
    It aims to provide a FHIR-based implementation of the record management principles outlined in these standards.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are EHR and PHR system developers and implementers who need to adhere to the ISO/HL7 standards for record lifecycle management. The beneficiaries include:
     * Patients: Indirectly, as it ensures the integrity, auditability, and reliability of their health records.
     * Healthcare Providers: By providing a traceable history of record changes, supporting clinical decision-making.
     * Healthcare organizations: By supporting compliance with record management requirements.
