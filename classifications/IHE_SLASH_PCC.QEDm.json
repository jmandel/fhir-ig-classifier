  "rationale": "The IHE PCC QEDm (Query for Existing Data for Mobile) Implementation Guide defines a transaction for querying clinical data elements using FHIR resources. It focuses on enabling mobile applications to access clinical data, such as observations, allergies, problems, medications, immunizations, procedures, and encounters. The guide specifies a RESTful API (PCC-44) for querying these data elements, leveraging the FHIR standard (specifically R4). It defines actors like the Clinical Data Consumer and Clinical Data Source, along with various options for querying specific types of clinical data. The guide also addresses security considerations, including audit logging, and provides guidance on handling access denied scenarios. It references other IHE profiles like MHD and mXDE for document sharing and data element extraction, respectively. The artifacts created include CapabilityStatements for the actors, defining the supported FHIR resources and search parameters, and AuditEvent profiles for security logging. The guide also includes examples of FHIR resources and bundles for demonstration purposes. It supports the Universal Realm but also includes national extensions for the US, specifically referencing the HL7 FHIR Profile for Occupational Data for Health (ODH).",
