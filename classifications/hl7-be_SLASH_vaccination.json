EHR systems are central to recording and sharing this data. Public health systems are key for surveillance and monitoring. Pharmacy systems play a role in providing vaccine information. Clinical decision support systems will utilize this data for alerts and recommendations. Payer systems have minimal involvement, mainly related to funding information. PHR systems may provide patients access to their vaccination records. Research platforms may use this data for epidemiological studies. Imaging and Lab systems are not directly involved.",

Its primary goal is to improve the accuracy, completeness, and accessibility of vaccination records. Therefore, Clinical Care Teams and Public Health Agencies are the core users, as they directly benefit from and drive the need for this standardization. Government Agencies also play a significant role in enforcing and overseeing the implementation. Patients and Caregivers benefit indirectly from improved care coordination and access to records. Payers and Research Organizations have a minimal role in this specific IG, as it primarily focuses on the clinical and public health aspects of vaccination data.",
