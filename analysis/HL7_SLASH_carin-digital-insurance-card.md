# carin-digital-insurance-card: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to standardize the digital representation of health insurance card information using FHIR. It focuses on enabling insurance members to access their insurance card details via consumer-facing applications, providing a digital alternative to physical insurance cards. The context is the need for a standard way to exchange insurance card data electronically, addressing challenges in representing all data elements found on physical cards within a FHIR-based transaction.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing a standard way to represent all beneficiaries on a plan, including their member IDs, which was not previously standardized in the base FHIR Coverage resource. It also allows for unique identifiers and consumer-friendly names for networks, and enables the representation of copays as text strings when SimpleQuantity or Money data types are insufficient. Additionally, it standardizes how images found on insurance cards can be expressed in FHIR. The IG also expands upon the base FHIR resources to include extensions for plan beneficiaries, additional card information, card issue date, color palettes, logos, QR codes, barcodes and supporting images. Finally, the IG introduces support for SMART Health Links for portable, verifiable digital insurance cards in version 1.1.0.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include FHIR profiles for Coverage, Organization, and Patient resources tailored to insurance card data. It defines extensions to capture additional information like plan beneficiaries, card issue date, color palettes, logos, QR codes, barcodes and supporting images. The IG uses slicing to handle multiple identifiers and classes within the Coverage resource. It also uses CodeSystems and ValueSets to define codes for identifier types, coverage classes, copay types and contact types. It leverages SMART on FHIR for application launch and authorization and now includes support for SMART Health Links. The IG also defines Must Support requirements for data elements.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    The IG aligns with the FHIR standard for data exchange and references the FHIR Security specification, Security and Privacy Module, and Implementerâ€™s Safety Checklist. It also acknowledges HIPAA privacy and security requirements and other applicable laws. The IG also leverages US Core profiles for the base resources. It also references the WEDI Health Identification Card Implementation Guide, WEDI Virtual Clipboard, NYS DFS Title 11, section 52.69, and CAA/No Surprises Act, section 107.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are health insurance companies (payers) who implement the Health Plan API and consumer-facing application developers who create applications to retrieve and display insurance card information. Beneficiaries include insurance plan members (patients) who gain access to their insurance information digitally via these consumer-facing applications. The IG also benefits providers who can use the digital insurance card information for patient verification.
