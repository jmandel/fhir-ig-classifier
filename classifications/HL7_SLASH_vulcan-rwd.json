  "rationale": "The \"vulcan-rwd\" FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on defining how real-world data (RWD) can be represented in FHIR to support clinical research. It primarily deals with structuring existing clinical data from EHRs for secondary use in research, rather than defining new data collection methods. The IG specifies FHIR profiles, extensions, and search parameters to facilitate the retrieval of RWD for research purposes. It outlines four clinical research use cases (Acute Coronary Syndrome, Anti-TNFa Treatment, Diabetes, and COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness) to illustrate how RWD can be identified and extracted from EHRs. These use cases define cohort criteria and specify the types of data to be retrieved, such as patient demographics, medications, encounters, conditions, and observations. The IG emphasizes the use of FHIR resources and elements to represent these data elements in a standardized way. It also addresses technical considerations, such as handling missing data and defining conformance expectations for systems implementing the guide. The IG builds upon the International Patient Access (IPA) project, using IPA as a baseline for accessing and transferring healthcare data. It defines specific search parameters and profiles to support the retrieval of data relevant to clinical research. The IG's primary focus is on data modeling and exchange, defining how RWD should be structured and accessed within the FHIR framework. It does not delve into the specifics of clinical workflows or decision support logic but rather concentrates on the technical aspects of data representation and retrieval.",
