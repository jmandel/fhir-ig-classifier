# vrdr: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

-   **Primary interoperability challenges this IG addresses:** The Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) FHIR IG primarily addresses the challenge of standardizing the bidirectional exchange of mortality data between Jurisdictional Vital Records Offices (JVROs) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It also supports data exchange among JVROs. The IG focuses on defining the content of death records and associated coded information, rather than specifying the exchange mechanisms.
-   **Key clinical/business problems it solves:** The IG aims to improve the timeliness and accuracy of mortality reporting, reduce costs, and enhance public health surveillance and emergency response efforts by modernizing the reporting process. It also lays the groundwork for expanding automated, standards-driven information exchange to include tributary flows from physicians, medical examiners, coroners, funeral directors, and family members to JVROs, as well as between JVROs and secondary users of mortality data.
-   **Intended scope and boundaries:** The IG's scope is primarily the reporting of death incidents by State Registrars to the NCHS, based on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death and associated edit specifications. While focused on this specific data flow, the FHIR resource profiles are designed to be reusable in related preceding and antecedent data flows, such as medicolegal death investigation and birth records. The IG does not specify message transport mechanisms, which are covered in a separate messaging IG.

## Technical Foundation

-   **Core profiles and extensions:** The IG defines numerous profiles based on FHIR resources, including `DeathCertificateDocument` (a Bundle), `DeathCertificate` (a Composition), `Decedent` (derived from US Core Patient), `DeathDate`, `DeathLocation`, `CauseOfDeathPart1`, `CauseOfDeathPart2`, `MannerOfDeath`, and others. Key extensions include `FilingFormat`, `ReplaceStatus`, `StateSpecificField`, `NVSSSexAtDeath`, and `AliasStatus`.
-   **Notable operations and interactions:** The IG does not define specific operations but implies the use of FHIR messaging for data exchange. The focus is on the structure and content of the `DeathCertificateDocument` bundle, which contains the `DeathCertificate` composition and referenced resources.
-   **Key terminology and value sets:** The IG utilizes standard terminologies like LOINC, SNOMED CT, and ICD-10, along with custom value sets for concepts specific to death reporting, such as `ActivityAtTimeOfDeathVS`, `CertifierTypesVS`, `MannerOfDeathVS`, and `MethodOfDispositionVS`. It also references value sets from the Vital Records Common Library (VRCL).
-   **Significant patterns and constraints:** The IG follows a document-centric approach using a Bundle of type `document` to represent a complete death record. The `DeathCertificate` composition acts as the core, referencing other resources within the bundle. The IG leverages US Core profiles where applicable and introduces constraints to align with death reporting requirements. It also defines specific mappings to the existing Inter-Jurisdictional Exchange (IJE) format.

## Technical Essence

The VRDR IG defines a FHIR-based representation of death records for exchange between vital records offices and the NCHS. At its core is the `DeathCertificateDocument`, a Bundle of type `document` containing a `DeathCertificate` Composition and all associated resources. The `DeathCertificate` Composition, based on the standard FHIR Composition resource, structures the death record into sections like Decedent Demographics, Death Investigation, Death Certification, and Decedent Disposition. Each section references relevant FHIR resources profiled for death reporting, such as `Decedent` (derived from US Core Patient), `DeathDate`, `DeathLocation`, `CauseOfDeathPart1`, and `CauseOfDeathPart2`. Coded content, like underlying cause of death, is represented using Observations with appropriate value sets (e.g., ICD-10 for cause of death). The IG also defines extensions like `FilingFormat` and `StateSpecificField` to capture additional data elements. The design emphasizes a document-centric approach, with the `DeathCertificateDocument` bundle serving as a complete, self-contained death record, enabling standardized exchange while accommodating existing IJE data elements through detailed mappings.

## Implementation Approach

-   **Critical workflows and interactions:** The IG supports workflows for submitting death records from JVROs to NCHS, transmitting coded cause of death and demographic information from NCHS to JVROs, exchanging death records among JVROs, and transmitting mortality rosters among JVROs. These workflows involve creating and exchanging `DeathCertificateDocument` bundles.
-   **Important requirements and guardrails:** Implementers must adhere to the defined profiles and extensions, ensuring data conforms to the specified value sets and constraints. While the IG provides flexibility in terms of required data elements, implementers must agree on the required fields for their specific exchanges, based on the IJE standard and NCHS requirements. The IG does not specify transport mechanisms, but the associated messaging IG provides guidance on this aspect.
-   **Notable design choices and patterns:** The document-centric approach using a Bundle to encapsulate the entire death record simplifies exchange and ensures data completeness. The use of US Core profiles as a base for several resources promotes interoperability with other FHIR-based systems. The detailed mappings to IJE fields facilitate the transition from legacy formats to FHIR.

## Ecosystem Context

-   **Target systems and users:** The primary target systems are JVRO systems and the NCHS system. Users include vital records offices, medical examiners, coroners, funeral directors, and potentially other entities involved in death reporting and data analysis.
-   **Relationship to other standards/IGs:** The VRDR IG depends on the Vital Records Common Library (VRCL) FHIR IG and is designed to be compatible with the Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR IG. It also relates to the NCHS Vital Records FHIR Messaging Implementation Guide, which specifies the messaging envelopes for data exchange.
-   **Relevant jurisdictions or programs:** The IG is relevant to all U.S. jurisdictions participating in the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).
-   **Primary use cases and scenarios:** The primary use cases are the submission of death records by JVROs to NCHS, the exchange of coded cause of death and demographic information from NCHS to JVROs, the exchange of death records among JVROs, and the transmission of mortality rosters among JVROs. These use cases support public health surveillance, emergency response, and other secondary uses of mortality data.
