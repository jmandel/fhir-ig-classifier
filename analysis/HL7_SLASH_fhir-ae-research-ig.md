# fhir-ae-research-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to standardize the way adverse events (AEs) are captured and reported in clinical research, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and other real-world data (RWD) sources like personal health records (PHRs). It seeks to create a common data model for AEs, bridging the gap between EHR data and clinical research requirements. The goal is to improve efficiency and accuracy in collecting and reporting AEs during clinical trials, ultimately facilitating regulatory safety reporting.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG leverages the HL7 FHIR standard to provide a structured, interoperable way to represent adverse event data. This improves upon previous approaches by:
    *   Enabling the electronic transmission of AE data between systems (e.g., EHRs, PHRs, clinical trial management systems) using a standardized format, eliminating the need for manual transcription.
    *   Providing a profile (AdverseEventClinicalResearch) that is specifically designed for the clinical research context.
    *   Defining extensions for capturing specific details relevant to clinical research, such as severity, grade, seriousness criteria, and whether the AE caused the subject to discontinue the study.
    *   Referencing and incorporating existing standards, such as FDA's E2B(R3) and CDISC mappings, to ensure alignment with regulatory requirements.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    *   **FHIR Profile:** The core of the IG is the `AdverseEventClinicalResearch` profile, which is based on the FHIR `AdverseEvent` resource.
    *   **Extensions:** Several extensions are defined, including:
        *   `AdverseEventSeverity` and `AdverseEventGrade` to capture the severity/grade of the AE.
        *   `CausedSubjectToDiscontinueStudy` to indicate if the AE led to study discontinuation.
        *   `SeriousnessCriteria` to capture the specific factors that made an AE serious.
    *   **ValueSets and CodeSystems:** The IG uses specific ValueSets and CodeSystems for concepts like severity, grade, seriousness criteria, outcome, and causality relatedness.  A custom code system (`adverse-event-severity-or-grade-cs`) and value set (`adverse-event-severity-or-grade-vs`) are defined for hierarchical severity and grade codes.
    *   **Invariant:** An invariant (`aeClinRes-seriousness-1`) is defined to enforce that if an AE is considered "serious", then at least one seriousness criterion must be present.
    *   **Examples:** The IG provides several realistic examples of how to use the profile in various clinical research scenarios, including cancer trials, device-related events, and patient-reported events.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    *   The IG aligns with regulatory reporting requirements, such as those specified in the FDA E2B(R3) guidance, by including elements needed for Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs).
    *   It uses terminologies and code systems from organizations like NCI and MedDRA, ensuring interoperability with other healthcare data sources.
    *   It incorporates existing standards like the CDISC FHIR Mapping to AE.
    *   It aims to support safety reporting requirements for investigational new drugs (INDs) and post-market surveillance.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    *   **Clinical Researchers/Investigators:** They can use the profile to capture adverse event data in a structured way within their EHR systems.
    *   **Clinical Trial Sponsors:** This IG helps sponsors receive consistent and standardized AE data from various sources, facilitating more efficient data aggregation and analysis.
    *   **Regulatory Agencies (e.g., FDA):** The IG supports the submission of standardized AE data, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of regulatory reviews.
    *   **Patients:** The IG supports patient-reported outcomes by allowing them to report AEs through patient-facing FHIR applications.
    *   **Healthcare Providers:** This IG also benefits healthcare providers by standardizing AE reporting across different systems.
