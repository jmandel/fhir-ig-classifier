    "summary": "The Da Vinci Patient Cost Transparency (PCT) Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, using it as the core standard for data representation and exchange. It leverages FHIR's RESTful API and resource model to define the structure and interactions for Good Faith Estimates (GFEs) and Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs). While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, they are not directly relevant to its core purpose. Cross-paradigm integration is present in a limited sense, as the IG builds upon US Core and HRex, which themselves may incorporate elements from other HL7 standards. However, this integration is not a primary focus of the PCT IG itself.",
