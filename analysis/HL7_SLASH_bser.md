# bser: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The Bidirectional Services eReferral (BSeR) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the exchange of referral information between healthcare providers and community-based organizations (CBOs) using the FHIR standard. 

**Context:** Referrals are often made for patients with chronic conditions who need additional support, such as diabetes prevention programs, obesity management, arthritis management, hypertension management, early childhood nutrition, and tobacco use cessation.

**Objectives:**
* **Streamline referrals:**  Make it easier for healthcare providers to electronically refer patients to appropriate services.
* **Improve communication:** Enable better communication between healthcare providers and CBOs about patient referrals and their progress.
* **Close the loop:** Ensure that referring providers receive feedback on the outcome of referrals.
* **Protect patient privacy:** Limit the exchange of clinical information to the minimum necessary to fulfill the referral.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The IG explicitly addresses the limitations of previous approaches by:

* **Standardizing data exchange:**  Previous referral processes often relied on paper-based or ad-hoc electronic methods, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. BSeR uses FHIR to standardize data elements and exchange formats.
* **Ensuring closed-loop communication:**  Traditional referrals often lacked a mechanism for feedback to the referring provider. BSeR mandates feedback using FHIR resources, ensuring the referring provider is informed about the patient's progress.
* **Prioritizing patient privacy:** BSeR emphasizes the "minimum necessary" standard for sharing patient data, addressing concerns about unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

* **FHIR profiles:** BSeR defines FHIR profiles for resources like ServiceRequest, Task, Composition, and Observation, tailoring them for referral-specific use cases.
* **Batch query Bundles:**  Used to define and retrieve data elements relevant to each specific referral use case, promoting interoperability and data consistency.
* **State machine:** A clearly defined state machine governs the referral workflow, tracking the referral's progress through various stages (e.g., requested, accepted, completed).
* **Transport flexibility:**  Supports both FHIR Messaging (for intermediary-based exchange) and RESTful API interactions (for direct, point-to-point exchange).

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

* **FHIR R4:** The IG is compliant with the FHIR Release 4 standard, leveraging its capabilities for robust healthcare data exchange.
* **US Core profiles:**  BSeR reuses and extends profiles from the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard, ensuring alignment with national interoperability efforts.
* **HIPAA:** The IG's emphasis on the "minimum necessary" standard directly supports HIPAA's Privacy Rule, protecting patient privacy.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

* **Referral initiating providers:**  Physicians or other healthcare professionals who refer patients to CBOs or other providers for specific services.
* **Referral recipient providers:**  CBOs or healthcare providers who receive referrals and provide the requested services.
* **Patients:**  Patients benefit indirectly from streamlined referrals, improved communication, and better coordination of care. They also benefit from the IG's focus on protecting their privacy.
* **Intermediaries:** Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) or CBO hubs that facilitate data exchange between referring and recipient providers.
