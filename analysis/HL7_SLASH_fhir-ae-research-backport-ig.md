# fhir-ae-research-backport-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    This IG aims to standardize the way adverse event (AE) data is captured and reported within clinical research, using the HL7 FHIR standard. It addresses variations in AE definitions, workflows, and data requirements across different use cases like patient monitoring, clinical intervention, regulatory reporting, and clinical trials. It aims to facilitate the collection of AEs from real-world data sources (EHRs, PHRs) and transmit them via FHIR to other systems, reducing manual transcription and improving reporting efficiency. The primary context is clinical research, both pre-market and post-market, for reporting AEs.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG provides a structured, standardized approach to capturing and reporting AE data using FHIR, which improves upon previous approaches by:
    *   Leveraging existing standards (FDA E2B(R3), CDISC FHIR Mapping, ICH E2A, CDASH, FDA safety reporting requirements, MedWatch) to create a unified data model.
    *   Enabling the use of real-world data (EHRs, PHRs) as electronic sources for AE data collection, reducing manual transcription.
    *   Facilitating interoperable data exchange between different systems using FHIR, such as EHRs, clinical trial management systems, sponsor systems, and regulatory authorities.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   A FHIR Profile, `AdverseEvent-clinical-research`, which extends the base `AdverseEvent` resource with extensions to capture clinical research specific data elements such as 'Expected In Research Study', 'Status', 'Contributing Factor', 'Mitigating Action', 'Suspect Entity' and 'Seriousness Criteria'.
    *   Use of ValueSets to define terminologies for elements like 'Adverse Event Status', 'Adverse Event Type', 'Adverse Event Contributing Factor', 'Adverse Event Mitigating Action', 'Causality Relatedness', and 'Adverse Event Seriousness Criteria'.
    *   Use of CodeSystems to define codes for 'FDA Additional Seriousness Criteria' and 'Adverse Event Severity or Grade'.
    *   Constraints and invariants defined to ensure data consistency and validity, such as requiring at least one seriousness criterion if the adverse event is serious.
    *   Examples of how the profile can be used in various clinical research scenarios, including patient reporting, investigator reporting, and device related adverse events.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG directly relates to and builds upon broader healthcare standards and regulations by:
    *   Using HL7 FHIR as the underlying standard for data exchange.
    *   Aligning with existing regulatory standards such as FDA E2B(R3), ICH E2A, and FDA safety reporting guidelines.
    *   Mapping to CDISC standards to align with clinical trial data collection requirements.
    *   Referencing terminologies from SNOMED CT, MedDRA and LOINC.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    Primary users and beneficiaries include:
    *   **Clinical Researchers:** Investigators, research staff, and sponsors involved in clinical trials who need to collect and report AE data.
    *   **Regulatory Authorities:** Agencies like the FDA who receive and review AE reports.
    *   **Healthcare Providers:** Clinicians who need to record and manage AEs occurring in clinical practice.
    *   **Patients:** Can benefit from improved safety monitoring and reporting of adverse events through patient-facing applications. The IG allows for patient reported outcomes via patient facing apps, which can be sent to researchers or regulatory bodies.
