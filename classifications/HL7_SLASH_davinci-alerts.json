    "summary": "This Implementation Guide focuses on building a FHIR-based messaging framework for unsolicited notifications. It heavily relies on FHIR resources and operations, particularly the Bundle and MessageHeader resources, and the $process-message operation. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it does not directly utilize or integrate them into its core functionality. The IG's purpose is to define a specific use case within the FHIR ecosystem, making FHIR the foundational standard.",

It utilizes the $process-message operation, which falls under Services, for message transmission. While REST APIs are mentioned in the context of FHIR interactions, the IG's core is not built around defining new RESTful endpoints. Messaging is the central pattern, and Data Profiles are heavily used to define the structure of the notification messages. Decision Support, Documents, Forms & UI, and Subscriptions are not central to this IG's current scope.",
