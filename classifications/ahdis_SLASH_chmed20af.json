    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (CHMED) is fundamentally based on FHIR, defining a FHIR-based representation of the Swiss eMediplan. It leverages FHIR resources, profiles, and the document paradigm for medication information exchange. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, they are not directly relevant to its core purpose. The IG demonstrates a deliberate effort to bridge the gap between the existing eMediplan format and FHIR, showcasing a strong commitment to FHIR as the foundation for interoperability in the Swiss eHealth ecosystem.",

    "summary": "The CHMED IG focuses on defining FHIR document structures (Medication Card and Medication Prescription) for exchanging medication information based on the Swiss eMediplan format. It heavily relies on data profiles and terminology to map the eMediplan to FHIR resources and uses the `$document` operation for exchange. It leverages extensions to capture eMediplan-specific data. While REST APIs are used for the `$document` operation, the IG doesn't define other custom services or extensively use messaging or subscriptions.",
