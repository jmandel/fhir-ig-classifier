# crmi-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the management of FHIR-based knowledge artifacts (like profiles, value sets, measures, and decision support rules) by defining how they are created, shared, and implemented. It focuses on ensuring these artifacts are consistently handled throughout their lifecycle, from authoring to publishing and use. The context is the development and implementation of healthcare standards and applications that rely on these knowledge artifacts. The IG is for anyone involved in creating, distributing, or using FHIR-based knowledge artifacts.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves on previous approaches by providing a unified framework for managing knowledge artifacts that were previously handled in a fragmented way across different IGs. It defines common profiles, operations, and capability statements applicable to a wide range of artifact types, rather than just specific resources. It also introduces the concept of a "version manifest" to ensure stable and predictable behavior of artifacts by managing dependencies and terminology versions. Additionally, it provides a structured approach to packaging artifacts with their dependencies, addressing a key challenge in the sharing and reuse of complex knowledge artifacts.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **Capability Profiles:** Defines profiles (Shareable, Computable, Publishable, Executable) to categorize artifacts based on their lifecycle stage and purpose.
    *   **Operations:** Defines FHIR operations for managing artifacts, such as `$package`, `$data-requirements`, `$draft`, `$release`, `$approve`, and `$review`.
    *   **Version Manifests:** Uses Library resources to establish version bindings for code systems and other canonical resources, ensuring stable artifact behavior.
    *   **Artifact Packaging:** Provides guidelines for packaging artifacts using FHIR Bundles and FHIR Packages (NPM) to include dependencies.
    *   **Terminology Service:** Defines requirements for terminology services to support artifact authoring and implementation, including value set expansion with version control.
    *   **Extensibility:** Includes extensions to support additional metadata and functionality for resources, such as `cqf-shouldTraceDependency` and `cqf-expansionParameters`.
    *   **Dependency Tracing:** Provides a mechanism to determine all resources required by a given artifact recursively.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds upon existing FHIR standards and addresses the needs of various healthcare domains, such as clinical guidelines, quality measurement, and public health reporting. It aims to provide a consistent way to use FHIR to represent and share knowledge artifacts. It also supports use of standardized terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) and enables the creation of content that can be used across various healthcare systems. By providing a clear framework for managing artifacts, this IG can help ensure that clinical systems can reliably use and integrate knowledge artifacts in a standards-compliant manner.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users of this IG are:
    *   **Modelers:** Authors of FHIR profiles and extensions.
    *   **Terminologists:** Those who manage and define terminologies.
    *   **Knowledge Developers:** Authors of clinical decision support rules, quality measures, and guidelines.
    *   **Software Developers:** Developers building systems that use knowledge artifacts, such as EHRs, reporting systems, and decision support platforms.

    While patients are not direct users of this IG, they are indirect beneficiaries. By enabling better management and sharing of knowledge artifacts, this IG promotes the development of more consistent, reliable, and evidence-based healthcare systems, which ultimately improve patient care and outcomes.
