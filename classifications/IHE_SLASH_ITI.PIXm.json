    "summary": "The ITI PIXm Implementation Guide primarily leverages FHIR for its RESTful API and resource definitions, making it heavily dependent on the FHIR standard. It does not use CDA or v2, and while it acknowledges v3 through its relationship with PIXV3, it doesn't directly utilize v3 models. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it offers a FHIR-based alternative to existing IHE profiles that might use other HL7 standards, but this integration is not a core aspect of the IG itself.",

It has a strong emphasis on identity and security through audit logging and potential integration with ATNA and IUA.

EHR systems are central to managing and accessing patient data, making them core implementers.

While not directly involved in core functionality, Payer and Public Health systems might need to integrate for specific use cases like claims processing or population health analysis. Lab and Pharmacy systems may need to look up patient identifiers, but their involvement is less central.
