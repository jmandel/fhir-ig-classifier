  "rationale": "The `dk-medcom-hospitalnotification` FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines a system for exchanging hospital notifications in Denmark. This IG focuses on creating a standardized way to inform municipalities about patient hospitalizations, including admissions, leaves, and discharges. \n\nThe core of this IG is the definition of a `HospitalNotification` message, built using FHIR resources and profiles. It specifies a `MedComHospitalNotificationMessage` profile, which is a constrained `MedComMessagingMessage`. This message contains a `MedComHospitalNotificationMessageHeader`, which further constrains the `MedComMessagingMessageHeader` to specify details like the event code (`hospital-notification-message`) and disallowing carbon-copy destinations. The message also includes a `MedComHospitalNotificationEncounter` profile, derived from `MedComCoreEncounter`, which carries the clinical information about the hospitalization, such as status, class, start/end times, and leave periods. \n\nAdditionally, the IG defines specific constraints and extensions, such as `MedComHospitalNotificationLeavePeriodExtension` for managing leave periods, and extensions for requesting and specifying the recipient of a report of admission. It also references other MedCom IGs like `MedCom Core`, `MedCom Messaging`, and `MedCom Terminology` for foundational elements and value sets. The IG provides detailed guidance on timestamps, IDs, and includes several simplified examples of different hospital notification scenarios, such as 'Start hospital stay - admitted', 'Start leave', 'End leave', 'End hospital stay', 'Deceased', and 'Cancellation'.\n\nIn essence, this IG establishes a data model and exchange mechanism for hospital notifications within the Danish healthcare system, leveraging FHIR messaging and profiling capabilities to ensure interoperability and consistency in communication between hospitals and municipalities.",
