  "rationale": "The CARIN Real-time Pharmacy Benefit Check (RTPBC) Implementation Guide is focused on enabling patients to access information about their pharmacy benefits, specifically regarding medication costs and coverage. It defines a process for a patient-facing application to query either the patient's insurer (or their agent, like a PBM) or a medication pricing source to obtain this information. \n\nThe IG specifies the use of FHIR R4 resources, primarily Claim and ClaimResponse, to model the request and response. It defines specific profiles for these resources, along with others like Patient, Coverage, MedicationRequest, and Organization, to carry the necessary data elements for the exchange. The IG also defines new value sets and code systems to represent concepts like benefit restrictions and patient pay types in a consumer-friendly manner. \n\nRegarding the scope, the IG is designed for the US market, considering US-specific pharmacy benefit roles and conventions. It focuses on medications covered under the pharmacy benefit, excluding those administered in inpatient or medical procedure settings. The IG also outlines business rules, such as the use of representative NDC11 identifiers and the \"point-in-time\" nature of the response. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the IG specifies the use of the $process-message operation for submitting the RTPBC request and receiving a synchronous response. It also defines CapabilityStatements for both the requester and responder, outlining the expected capabilities of each. Error handling is addressed through the use of ClaimResponse.error and OperationOutcome. \n\nIn summary, the CARIN RTPBC IG provides a detailed specification for a FHIR-based, patient-centric real-time pharmacy benefit check process, focusing on data modeling, data exchange mechanisms, and workflow support within the US healthcare context.",
