    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally built upon FHIR to define and manage terminologies for the Danish healthcare sector, specifically for MedCom's messaging standards. It does not directly utilize CDA, v2, or v3, but acknowledges the need for mapping to SOREDI, which suggests a minimal relationship with older HL7 standards. Cross-paradigm integration is not a primary focus, but the mapping to SOREDI hints at a potential future need.",

It provides a centralized repository of CodeSystems, ValueSets, and ConceptMaps to ensure consistent and unambiguous exchange of clinical and administrative information. While it touches upon various domains through its terminology, its core purpose is to establish a standardized vocabulary for healthcare communication, making it heavily reliant on administrative and workflow aspects for message exchange. Clinical data is supported through relevant terminologies, but the IG itself doesn't define clinical data profiles or structures.",

It primarily impacts systems involved in exchanging clinical and administrative information using these standards. EHR systems are central to this exchange, requiring extensive integration. Systems sending or receiving messages, like Pharmacy and Lab systems, will also need significant integration. Payer systems might need to understand the terminology for claims processing, while Public Health systems could use it for data aggregation. Clinical Decision Support systems may leverage the standardized terminology for improved accuracy. Research platforms might use it for data consistency. PHR systems have minimal interaction, primarily needing to display human-readable terms.",
