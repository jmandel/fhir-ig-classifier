File: repos/HL7_SLASH_fhir-military-service/input/pagecontent/conformance-general.md

This section outlines requirements and recommendations for Military Service History participants. The
conformance verbs - SHALL or MUST, SHOULD, and MAY - are defined in [FHIR
Conformance Rules](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html).

### Military Service History Participant Roles

Two roles for **Military Service History Participants** are defined:

-   **Military Service History and Status (Military Service History) Data Sender** - a system
    provides Military Service History data in response to a data query or autonomously pushes Military Service History
    data to an Military Service History receiver. The data sender does not have to be the originator
    of the data it possesses. The data sender role is similar to a [US Core
    Responder](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-actors), except the
    data sent is not assumed to be a response to a query.

    -   This role may be played may be FHIR server enabled API.

-   **Military Service History Data Receiver** - a system involved in exchange of Military Service History data that
    accepts Military Service History data from an Military Service History Data Sender. The data receiver may receive data
    as part of a predetermined workflow or initiate the exchange via a query or
    on a regular basis via subscription. The receiver role is similar to a [US
    Core Requestor](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-actors), except
    the data does not have to be explicitly requested.

    -   This role may be a played by an EHR system, web application,
        patient-facing application, etc.

This implementation currently only provides
[CapabilityStatements](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/capstatements.html)
consistent with FHIR US Core and documentation for "pull" (query-response)
architectures, however, regardless how exchanges occur, all participants MUST
follow the conformance requirements in this IG, **except** those specifically
identified as applying only to pull architectures.

### "MUST" Requirements for Conformance

-   Patient resources \*\* veteranStatus operation

-   Observation resource Both resources implemented consistent with US Core

#### Publish a CapabilityStatement Identifying Supported Profiles and Operations

Each Military Service History participant MUST publish a FHIR CapabilityStatement listing their
supported profiles, by declaring the profile in
`CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile`. The CapabilityStatement
SHALL be returned in response to a `GET [base]/metadata` request.

ALL Military Service History participants MUST at minimum support the [MilitaryServiceEpisode], 
[DeploymentEpisode] profiles. Ideally, the [MilitaryOccupation] will also be
included to specify what military occupation or occupations were performed
during military service.

#### Support US Core Conformance Requirements

Additional [conformance requirements from US
Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/capstatements.html) apply to RESTful
interactions, searches, and resource formats in Military Service History. Military Service History "inherits" all US Core
conformance requirements. US Core provides base profiles for many (but not all)
Military Service History profiles, defines the meaning of MustSupport, and outlines expectations for
handling of missing or unknown data elements. Likewise, US Core outlines how to
associate provenance information associated with collection, transfer, and
updating of clinical information.

International users of Military Service History may find US Core an impediment to implementation.
Application of Military Service History to other countries is open to further discussion.

### "SHOULD" Recommendations for Conformance

Military Service History participants SHOULD meet the following requirements for conformance:

1.  [Support all Military Service Profiles](#support-all-military-service-history-profiles)

2.  [Use to indicate Conformance](#use-metaprofile-to-signal-conformance)

#### Support All Military Service History Profiles

In addition to supporting the core profiles as described above, Military Service History participants
SHOULD support all profiles defined in Military Service History UNLESS the participant does not
anticipate supplying or consuming a certain type of data, usually by virtue of
playing a limited or specialized role in clinical or information workflows.

Participants SHOULD also support the custom operation (\$**veteranStatus**)
specified in this implementation

#### Use `meta.profile` to Signal Conformance

Participants SHOULD populate `meta.profile` elements for all resources to
indicate which profiles the resources should conform to. Participants SHOULD
also implement [profile search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#profile),
which allows participants to query using the `_profile` parameter to return
resources conforming to the profiles declared in `meta.profile`.

Profile search and population of `meta.profile` originate as "SHALL"
requirements in the base FHIR specification; they are not an additional
requirements imposed by Military Service History. However, in practice, few implementations have
followed these requirements. Refer to the [FHIR Documentation on supported
profiles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile)
for details.

### Capability Statements

This implementation specifies a specialization of the generic US core
implementation guide and the capabilities:

{% include markdown-link-references.md %} [FHIR US Core Capability Statement -
[Server]:
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CapabilityStatement-us-core-server.html [FHIR
US Core Capability Statement -
Client]:https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CapabilityStatement-us-core-client.html

-   The Verification API/Server will conform with US Core ([US Core
    Responder](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-actors)) and SHALL
    support the profiles and custom operation specified in this implementation
    guide.

-   The application/Client will conform with US Core ([US Core
    Requestor](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-actors)) and SHALL
    interpret and process the information specified in the profiles described in
    this implementation guide.

    {% include markdown-link-references.md %}

### Profile Base

Most MSH profiles are based on US Core profiles defined in the [US Core Implementation Guide (v3.1.1)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html). For
example, the [US Veteran profile](StructureDefinition-usveteran.html) is based on the [US Core Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html)
profile. Because of the way profiles work in FHIR, any resource that validates against an MSH profile that is based a US Core profile will automatically be in
compliance with the US Core profile and the associated US Core Data for Interperability (USCDI) data element required by [US regulation](https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/).
 
-   [Military Service Episode](StructureDefinition-military-service-episode.html) profile can be used to create Observatoin resources that describe a Veteran's military service history; it includes references to [Deployment Episode](StructureDefinition-deployment-history-episode.html)  and [Military Occupation](StructureDefinition-military-service-Occupation.html).

-   [Military Occupation](StructureDefinition-military-service-Occupation.html)is similar to [ODH
    PastOrPresentJob](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/StructureDefinition-odh-PastOrPresentJob.html). It is referenced by [Military Service
    Episode](StructureDefinition-military-service-episode.html).

Where US Core does not provide an appropriate base profile, this implementation profiles FHIR
resources directly as described below:

### Conformance to MSH Profiles

Each MSH profile expresses requirements and expectations for FHIR instances in
terms of structural constraints and terminology bindings. If an instance is
required to conform with an MSH profile, it MUST
[validate](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/validation.html) against that profile.

#### Data Sender Expectations

Each MSH profile has a conformance statement describing what data or FHIR
instances MUST or SHOULD conform to it.

#### Data Receiver Expectations

An MSH Data Receiver SHOULD perform validation on instances it receives. The
Receiver first of all needs to identify which profile to use for validation.
There four ways to identify the correct profile:

1.  The instance is received in response to a [profile
    search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#profile), so the validating
    profile is known in advance.

2.  The instance self-identifies using `meta.profile`. Every Data Sender SHALL
    populate this element to specify which type of information was used/provided to consumer/receivers of military service history.

3.  The Data Receiver can examine the contents of the instance to associate it
    with a profile (in particular, by looking for identifying code or category).

4.  The Data Receiver can iteratively attempt to validate the instance against
    each of the Data Receiver's supported profiles.

If an instance fails validation, the Receiver may reject the instance.

### Element-Level Expectations

#### Sender and Receiver Expectations

For every element that is [required](#required-elements) and/or carries a [Must
Support obligation](#must-support-obligations) (MS):

-   MSH Data Senders SHALL be capable of populating the element, provided the
    Sender supports the profile (as indicated by its CapabilityStatement).

-   If the Sender lacks the data necessary to populate the element:

    -   If the element is required, the [US Core rules on missing
        data](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data)
        MUST be followed.

    -   If the element is not required (but is MS), the element SHOULD be
        entirely omitted. If there is a specific reason the data is missing, a
        data absent reason MAY be substituted.

    -   Senders MUST NOT substitute a nonsense or filler value just to satisfy
        MS or cardinality requirement.

-   MSH Data Receivers SHALL be capable of meaningfully processing MS elements,
    provided the Receiver supports the profile. Depending on context,
    "meaningfully process" might mean displaying the data element for human use,
    reacting to it, or storing it for other purposes.

#### Required Elements

An MSH data element is **required** if any of the following criteria are met:

-   The element is a top-level element (a first-level property of the resource)
    and its minimum cardinality is \> 0 in the profile.

-   The element not a top-level element (a second-level property or below), its
    minimum cardinality is \> 0, and all elements directly containing that
    element have minimum cardinality \> 0 in the profile.

-   The element is not a top-level element, its minimum cardinality is \> 0, and
    its immediate higher-level containing element exists in an *instance*
    attempting to conform to the profile.

In other words, a data element may be `1..1`, but if it is contained by an
optional element, then it is not required unless its containing element is
actually present.

#### Must Support Obligations

Interpretation of MS is not straightforward, as there is a difference between a
MS *obligation* and a MS *flag*. The MS *flag* is the red S displayed on profile
pages: S. A MS *obligation* means the element must be treated as described in
[Sender and Receiver Expectations](#sender-and-receiver-expectations).
Significantly, an MS *flag* (S) does not necessarily imply an MS *obligation*,
and MS *obligations* may be attached to elements lacking MS *flags*.

To see which elements have MS flags, consult the "Snapshot Table" view of the
profile. The "Differential Table" view hides MS flags inherited from the parent
profile. The "Snapshot Table (Must Support)" view reflects the IG Publisher's
interpretation of how MS flags translate to MS obligations, which may or may not
coincide with the US Core/MSH interpretation.

The following rules apply in MSH:

-   A profile without a MS flag does not have to be supported [^1]. A
    participant MUST declare support for optional profiles in its
    CapabilityStatement.

    [^1]: Although not common practice, profiles can have MS flags at the data
        element.

-   Any MS flag or flags on an unsupported profile (as stated in participant's
    CapabilityStatement) do not carry MS obligations.

-   An element with an MS flag does not carry an MS obligation if it is nested
    and any one of the elements directly containing that element lacks an MS
    flag. However, if the participant *elects* to support the unflagged element
    or elements in that hierarchy, the elements below the gap then carry an MS
    obligation.

-   An element with an MS flag whose cardinality is 0..0 does not carry an MS
    obligation [^2].

    [^2]: When inheriting from another profile, it is possible to set the upper
        cardinality to zero on an element that was MS in the parent profile. For
        example, you could inherit from US Core Patient, but forbid the
        patientâ€™s name for privacy reasons. In this case, neither Sender nor
        Receiver are expected to populate or support the element â€“ in fact, it
        would be an error if the element were present.

-   A [required element](#required-elements) carries a MS obligation on the part
    of a Data Sender, regardless of whether that element has an MS flag.

-   A [required element](#required-elements) without an MS flag does not carry
    an MS obligation for the Data Receiver [^3].

    [^3]: An example is a Receiver that does not meaningfully process a required
        element even though it was populated by the Sender.

#### Non-Must Support Elements

Data elements in MSH that *do not have* MS obligations still MAY be supported.
If an element is supported, whether it has a MS flag or not, the profile must be
interpreted as if the MS flag were present. For example, `Observation.category`
does not have an MS flag, but a data receiver may implement the capability to
display it.

### Associated Extensions and Profile: US Veteran

To record the confirmed Veteran status, this IG has identified the need to
specify an extension on the Patient to specify whether the patient was confirmed
to be a veteran.
The US Vetrean profile extends the US Core Patient profile and adds the "vetaranStatus" data element as a true/false (boolean). If pilot projects need it, this extension can be revised to support a state machine for Veteran determination (e.g. submitted --> under verification --> verified:  eligible/ineligible/not a Veteran)
-   [US Veteran](StructureDefinition-usveteran.html) specifies a flag to indicate the veteran status
    as a boolean value.
A FHIR API may use veteran status extension specified in the US Patient profile
to implement the \$veteranStatus operation.

<img src="Associated Extensions related to Veteran Verification.png" 
alt="Associated Extensions related to Veteran Verification" width="100%" />
*Figure 6: Associated Extensions related to Veteran Verification*

#### Testing Guidance

The current VA API uses an ad-hoc verification operation and allows third-party
systems to retrieve the military service - including combat episodes. This track
will demonstrate how this API can be provided using a standards-based approach
that includes FHIR resources and terminology constraints using concepts from
LOINC, SNOMED CT, and CDC ODH - as specified in the associated Logica project
intended to validate the extensions needed to represent Military Service and
Combat Episodes using Observation resource similar to ODH. The current REST API
is used primarily verify veteran status for benefits associated with military
service (e.g., insurance coverage, discounts, education assistance, etc.). The
enhanced FHIR-based API will make this API readily available for health-related
purposes: social determinants of health, risk factors for specific conditions
(e.g. health disease, major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation).

In addition to proving the feasibility of FHIR resources to provide equivalent
capabilities to the current API, this project will also introduce
standards-based concepts in place of local VA terminology for discharge status
and separation reason as well we reusing CDC ODH concept to represent the
military branch and pay grade of a Veteran.

#### Testing Workflow

This workflow identifies the activities and API calls required to address the
requirements specified in the [Use Case Analysis](#use-case-analysis).
Successful testing may also use test scripts and pre-conditions to results of an EHR invoking the proposed
API to verify status and retrieve the military history information of a Veteran
using FHIR-based resources. This diagram uses Object Management Groupâ€™s (OMG) Business Process
Modeling Notation (BPMN) to describe the pre-conditions/triggers and
post-conditions/results of using the FHIR-based API outlined in this
implementation guide:

<img src="Testing Workflow.png" alt="Testing Workflow" width="100%" />
*Figure 7: Testing Workflow*

##### Verify Veteran Status: Step 1

Scenario \#1: Veteran Confirmation and Verification

A Veteran is receiving treatment in the community and invokes the
"\$veteranStatus" operation using the Veteran's demographics (e.g. first name, last name,
date of birth, social security number). If the Veteran is verified then the
client application proceed to Step 2.

Scenario Step 1 : Search the Patient resource to evaluate whether "Sam Share" is
a confirmed/validated Veteran based on the VA-specific extension

##### Search Military Service History: Step 2

Scenario Step 2: Search the Observation resource for a list of Military Service
Episodes: search by "subject" (i.e. Patient/Veteran) and by "patient" and "code"
search parameters

For more details on testing, you may refer to the [FHIR Connectathon 25 (September 2020) Track for Military Service History and Status](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-09+Social+History%3A++Verification+of+Military+Service+History+and+Status).

File: repos/HL7_SLASH_fhir-military-service/input/pagecontent/index.md

                                                                 
### Background
This implementation guide contains profiles and extensions to share Military Service History and Status using FHIR-based application programming interfaces (APIs) consistent with US regulatory requirements (i.e. Title 38 Veteran Benefits). This is a US-realm specificatoin but it is extensible to other realms/jurisdictions (e.g. Canadian Forces).
It harmonizes the requirements of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to record this information support of administrative and clinical workflows (e.g. exchange with community providers) and the work and social history of patients who are also Veterans.

### Use Case Analysis

The use case anlaysis describes requirements and associated capabilities to manage and
exchange information about Military Service History and Status. All requirements
are analyzed as use cases involving actors/participants and system interactions.

*Note:* Certain requirements were discussed, deemed to be out-of-scope, and
deferred (see [Deferred Requirements](#deferred-requirements)).

Figure 1 is a summary of scenarios (use cases) representing the requirements for
recording self-reported military and combat history. It also illustrates how
FHIR-based APIs can be used to validate employment history information reported
by Veterans.

<img src="Use Case Analysis Overview.png" alt="Use Case Analysis Overview*" width="100%" />
*Figure 1: Use Case Analysis Overview*

#### Use Case Analysis: Actors

##### Clinician
The clinician may be working with Veteran in the community and must assess the
health risks associated with military service.

##### Veteran
The Veteran is the focus of this specification. The API described here allows
Veterans to access and share their military service history and status
information with community and hospital-based clinicians, community service agencies, vendors, and
employers, etc. The Veteran can access their information or make it available to
entities that assist Veterans. Military Service History may be combined with
other employment history information.


#### Use Case Analysis: Use Cases

##### Request Employment History with Social History and Determinants of Health

The clinician is requesting employment information in conjunction with their
social history. If the patient is a Veteran, their employment history will
include military service information. This was a core requirement of the
Occupational Data for Heath (ODH) Implementation Guide we analyzed and reused.
The current specification expands this use case to specify application (i.e.
EHR) capabilities as well as reusable FHIR-based APIs that may be provided by an
authoritative organization (e.g. US Department of Veterans Affairs).

##### Record Military Service History and Status

The social history information reported by the patient - including employment
and military service history - is entered into a system of record used to capture such information and not explicitly EHR. 

##### Verify Veteran History

The EHR system, acting as a FHIR client, uses a standards-based VA RESTful API (FHIR Observation with profiles and extensions) to verify that the patient is a
Veteran and served in the military.

The query is triggered by an EHR. Based on the verification result,the EHR may validate the Veteran status and fill in the combat episodes as
needed to determine social history risks.

Official records and documentation from the military service record, DD214, and other pre--existing documentation can be referenced in the verification process.

##### Verify Veteran Status

The Verification API proposed in this document determines the Veteranâ€™s status
by using demographic information submitted as a query (search operation) to a
FHIR server that supports **Observation** resource - - using the **Patient**
endpoint to determine whether a person is a verified veteran. Additional
information is provided using the Search Service History criteria using the
profiles described in the [Information Requirements](#information-and-semantics-requirements) section (see [Military Service Episode](StructureDefinition-military-service-episode.html)).

##### Search Service History

This use case is part of the proposed verification API based on FHIR. If this
search operation returns one or more **Observation** resources that conform
[Military Service Episode]((StructureDefinition-military-service-episode.html) to the proposed profile,
the Veteran's status confirmed. If the search operation does not find any
matching Observation resources, the Veteran's service history could not be confirmed.

The presence of one or more Observations that conform to the [Deployment
Episode](StructureDefinition-deployment-history-episode.html) profile proposed here indicates that Veteran was deployed.

#### Deferred Requirements

The following use cases were discussed and deferred because they are
out-of-scope for the profiles and extensions described in this implementation
guide design document:


* **Prior Authorization:** U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) administrative transactions are currently used for prior authorization for healthcare services. This use case will not be addressed in this document but it may be relevant to future FHIR profiling efforts.
* **Apply for coverage:** A Veteran's military history and other service-related information are relevant to applying for healthcare coverage. This use case was discussed with the Financial Management Workgroup on March 31, 2020 and it will remain out-of-scope for this iteration of the specification. Military service history is relevant to establish level of care but will not be explored further in this document.
* **Schedule service-connected visit:** Another potential use case included scheduling a visit for a service-connected disorder or condition. This use case was discussed and deemed out-of-scope for now since it is related to level of disability and service-connected problems, as well as:
- -  an encounter related to a service-connected disability, special authority designation and those services are not billable;
- - care may be covered by special authority (e.g. neck/throat cancer); and,
- - coding system for special authority and service-related not in scope.

### Information and Semantics Requirements

 
This section describes the result harmonizing requirements to convey military service history and status at this time. It also harmonizes the content of the Occupational Data for Health Implementation Guide developed by CDC to enhance social history and employment history reporting from EHR systems.

Figure 2 summarizes the proposed profiles and extensions needed to document
military service history. The profiles described here constrain and extend the
normative Observation resources profile (Release 4 and later) to ensure
stability and reusability. FHIR Release 4 marked the first time some FHIR
resources have attained normative status and will be maintained in a manner that
ensure backwards-compatibility. Furthermore, using [Observation R4 and
later](http://build.fhir.org/observation.html) - rather than
[Basic](http://build.fhir.org/basic.html) resource - is the recommended approach
to creating extensible APIs based on FHIR.

<img src="Information Requirements.png" alt="Information Requirements" width="100%" />
*Figure 2: Information Requirements*

**Note:** FHIR implementation, localization, and profiling best-practices are
under development and evolving. This design document is intended to provide
reasoning and context for future projects.

## Military Service Episode

This profile design describes how we use observations,  components, and member resources to represent an historical continual Military Service within on branch of service.

As such a veteran's Military Service Episode may have zero or more military service deployment episodes. 

As such a veteran's Military Service Episode may have zero or more military occupations. 

Additionally, the veteran's Military Service Episode contains military discharge and separation reasons.

## Deployment History Episode
Deployment History Episode describes a completed deployment.  This is not intended to describe active duty deployments.  The veterans Deployment History Episode code can contain the mission, the country, the industry, and the supervisory level.

## Military Occupation
The profile reuses the [ODHPastOrPresentJob](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/StructureDefinition-odh-PastOrPresentJob.html)
profile to apply it specifically to military jobs/occupations. One or more military occupations may be referenced by a single Military Service
History record. This profile uses a subset of data elements as seen below:

### Terminology Requirements

An initial gap analysis of SNOMED CT terminology identified that we are missing
significant content related to discharge status requirements in
[DischargeStatusCode](#discharge-status-code).

Other terminology extension and harmonization targets are:

-   [Military Branch Code](#military-branch-code)

-   [Pay Grade Code](#pay-grade-code)

Another gap is "separation reason" that requires a coded concept for its
Observation component and its allowed values.

In the future, the [Combat Episode Mission Value Set](ValueSet-military-service-combat-episode-mission-vs.html) may also need a SNOMED CT
extension if the VA API requires it.

Value Set Name: Industry NAICS Detail (ODH)

Value Set OID 2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.7900

Value Set Description Concepts describing the kind of business that compensates
the person for work (e.g., wages, training) or assigns work to a volunteer, as
reported by the person. The kind of business is determined based on the primary
business activity conducted by the company, organization, or individual (for
those who are self-employed), or, for a military position, the self-reported
branch of service. The value set was created by coding the NAICS index terms,
which are relatable to the general public, to facilitate collection and
validation by patients. A downloadable file available from the PHIN VADS ODH Hot
Topics section is structured to support computer-assisted searching of this
value set. The file also contains a crosswalk from the concepts in this value
set to Occupation_CDC_Census value set concepts.

#### Discharge Status Code

A SNOMED CT Extension needed to describe the status when an individual leaves
military service.

The VA API and Z-segment specification declares local extensions to SNOMED CT
corresponding to **subtypes** of **"Left Military Service" 266964007 concept.**

**Question:** Should it include "active" because we may have a DoD API that
works in a similar way?

**Answer**: No, the cardinality should allow for this data element to omitted if
the service episode is the current episode.

#### Military Branch Code

"The military branch associated with service, National Guard, and Reserve."

The **Military Branches** coded concepts are documented in PHIN VADS as
[Industry CDC NAICS 2012 (ODH)](https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?id=3ED34BBC-617F-DD11-B38D-00188B398520).

**Localization Note:**

-   From an occupational standpoint, any foreign military service should be
    captured as well as US military service. The profile allows an
    "**extensible**" terminology binding to allow a service history that
    includes service in US and foreign armed forces.

-   The VA API will be limited to US Armed Forces; similarly, Canadian Forces
    will implement a realm-specific approach that accommodates Canadian
    requirements.

**Note:** the following is complete list of concepts to describe the military
branch.

**Additional**: NOAA and Merchant Marine members may also be included in this
value set.

#### Pay Grade Code

Defines the level of compensation for a position, normalized across military
branches. This value set harmonizes the concepts used in VA wit those specified
by FDA for Occupational Data for Health implementations.

This specification will use the latest FDA value set specified in [Job
Supervisory Level or Pay Grade](https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?id=D696FF02-C038-EB11-8196-005056ABE2F0).

#### Separation Reason Code

"Additional description for separation reason beyond discharge status value."

**Note:** This may need to be specified as a code value rather than a text
value.

### Terminology Requirements

An initial gap analysis of SNOMED CT terminology identified that we are missing
significant content related to discharge status requirements in
[DischargeStatusCode](#discharge-status-code).

Other terminology extension and harmonization targets are:

-   [Military Branch Code](#military-branch-code)

-   [Pay Grade Code](#pay-grade-code)

Another gap is "separation reason" that requires a coded concept for its
Observation component and its allowed values.

In the future, the [Mission Code](#mission-code) may also need a SNOMED CT
extension if the VA API requires it.

#### Military Branch Code

"The military branch associated with service, National Guard, and Reserve."

The **Military Branches** coded concepts are documented in PHIN VADS as
[Industry CDC NAICS 2012 (ODH)](https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?id=3ED34BBC-617F-DD11-B38D-00188B398520).

**Localization Note:**

-   From an occupational standpoint, any foreign military service should be
    captured as well as US military service. The profile allows an
    "**extensible**" terminology binding to allow a service history that
    includes service in US and foreign armed forces.

-   The VA API will be limited to US Armed Forces; similarly, Canadian Forces
    will implement a realm-specific approach that accommodates Canadian
    requirements.

**Note:** the following is complete list of concepts to describe the military
branch.

**Additional**: NOAA and Merchant Marine members may also be included in this
value set.

#### Pay Grade Code

Defines the level of compensation for a position, normalized across military
branches. This value set harmonizes the concepts used in VA wit those specified
by FDA for Occupational Data for Health implementations.

This specification will use the latest FDA value set specified in [Job
Supervisory Level or Pay Grade](https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?id=D696FF02-C038-EB11-8196-005056ABE2F0).

#### Separation Reason Code

"Additional description for separation reason beyond discharge status value."

**Note:** This may need to be specified as a code value rather than a text
value.

The US Veteran profile specifies an additional extension to the set already supported by the FHIR US Core profile it extends. This extension is a boolean flag used to specify/store the confirmation/verification status. true: the Patient record describes a Veteran or false: the Patient is either not a verified yet or under review if the flag is absent, then the veteran status is undetermined. |

### Profile
[USVeteran]

### Extension
[USVeteranStatus]

### Verification
Using patient match [patientmatch] verify existence of extension [USVeteranStatus] to evaluate veteran status.  A return missing extension completely is a result of undetermined.
