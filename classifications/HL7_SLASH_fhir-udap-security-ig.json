  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-udap-security-ig\" focuses on defining security protocols for scalable registration, authentication, and authorization within the HL7 FHIR ecosystem, particularly for business-to-business (B2B) applications. It extends OAuth 2.0 to enhance security and streamline workflows. \n\n**Functional Domain:** This IG primarily addresses **Infrastructure & Foundational** concerns, as it specifies security and privacy mechanisms that are fundamental to various healthcare interactions. It also touches upon **Administrative & Financial** aspects by enabling secure B2B transactions, which often involve administrative and financial data exchange. However, it does not directly address specific clinical care, public health, or research domains.\n\n**HL7 Standard:** The IG is explicitly based on **FHIR R4**, as indicated by the `fhirVersion` in the `sushi-config.yaml` file. It also references other standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, but its core focus is on FHIR.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The IG's primary purpose is to define **Security & Privacy** mechanisms for data exchange. It also supports **Data Exchange** by specifying how OAuth 2.0 should be used for authorization and authentication. Additionally, it includes elements of **Data Modeling** by defining specific parameters and structures for JWTs and other security-related data. **Workflow Support** is also a significant aspect, as the IG outlines workflows for registration, authorization, and authentication.\n\n**Geographic Scope:** The IG is primarily scoped for the **United States**, as indicated by the `jurisdiction` field in the `sushi-config.yaml` file and references to US-specific organizations like ONC. However, it is built upon international standards like OAuth 2.0 and FHIR, suggesting potential applicability beyond the US.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The IG is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders. **Technical Implementers**, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, will use it to implement secure data exchange. **Healthcare Provider Organizations** will rely on it to ensure secure interactions with other systems. **Administrative Organizations** will benefit from the secure B2B transaction capabilities. **Standards Organizations** are involved in the development and maintenance of the IG. **Public Health Organizations** may indirectly benefit from the secure data exchange enabled by the IG, although this is not a primary focus.",
