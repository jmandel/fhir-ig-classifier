# ITI.mXDE: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The ITI Mobile Cross-Enterprise Document Data Element Extraction (mXDE) IG aims to improve access to health data by enabling the extraction of specific data elements (like vital signs, medications) from shared clinical documents (like discharge summaries, prescriptions). This allows healthcare professionals and potentially patients to access the information they need in a more granular and efficient way, complementing the traditional sharing of whole documents.

**Context:** The IG addresses the challenge of consuming applications needing to be robust to the variability in how data is structured within clinical documents. It recognizes the need for both document-level and data element-level access to health information.

**Target Audience:** The IG is primarily intended for implementers of health information exchange systems who want to enable fine-grained access to health data alongside document sharing.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The IG explicitly states that it builds upon existing document sharing standards like XDS and MHD by adding the capability to extract and query specific data elements from those documents. This allows for more targeted and efficient access to the information contained within documents, which could be cumbersome to process as a whole. The use of Provenance ensures traceability back to the original source documents, enhancing data integrity and context.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Data Element Extraction:** The IG defines the role of a "Data Element Extractor" actor that is responsible for extracting specific data elements from shared documents and making them available as FHIR resources.
- **Provenance:** The IG leverages the FHIR Provenance resource to link extracted data elements back to their source documents, providing context and traceability. A specific profile "mXDE Provenance" is defined to standardize the use of Provenance in this context.
- **Query for Existing Data (QEDm):** The IG integrates with the QEDm profile to enable querying for extracted data elements using FHIR-based queries.
- **Document Sharing Integration:** The IG supports various document sharing standards like XDS, XCA, and MHD, allowing flexibility in implementation.
- **Security Considerations:** The IG emphasizes the importance of security and privacy and recommends the use of IHE security profiles like ATNA, XUA, and IUA to protect sensitive health information.

## 4. Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations

The IG aligns with broader healthcare interoperability efforts by leveraging established standards like FHIR, XDS, and MHD. It promotes data exchange and access, which are key goals of regulations like the 21st Century Cures Act in the United States. The emphasis on security and privacy also reflects the requirements of regulations like HIPAA.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Healthcare Professionals:** Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers can benefit from more efficient access to specific data elements they need for clinical decision-making, such as medication lists, allergies, and vital signs, without needing to process entire documents.
- **Patients:** While not explicitly stated, the IG could potentially benefit patients by enabling them to access their own data in a more user-friendly and granular way through patient portals or mobile apps.
- **Health IT Developers:** Implementers of health information exchange systems and developers of healthcare applications can use the IG as a guide to build systems that support fine-grained data access and improve interoperability.
- **Researchers:** The availability of extracted data elements could facilitate research by providing easier access to specific data points for analysis.
