    "summary": "This Implementation Guide (IG) is fundamentally based on FHIR R4, defining a RESTful API for consumer access to claims data. It heavily relies on FHIR resources and profiles, particularly ExplanationOfBenefit. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards like US Core (which itself is based on FHIR), it doesn't directly integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is limited to leveraging FHIR's capabilities to represent data that might traditionally be found in other formats.",

It leverages FHIR R4 and builds upon US Core profiles, emphasizing financial aspects of healthcare data. While it touches upon administrative, clinical data, and identity & security domains, its core purpose revolves around insurance and financial data exchange.",
