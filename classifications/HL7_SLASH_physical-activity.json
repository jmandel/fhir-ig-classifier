It leverages core FHIR resources like Observation, CarePlan, Goal, ServiceRequest, and Task to capture activity levels, create care plans, manage referrals, and track progress. While it touches upon administrative aspects through referral management and workflow coordination, its primary drive is to improve patient care by enabling better tracking and management of physical activity, making Clinical Data and Care Planning its core domains. It also has a strong emphasis on workflow related to referrals and task management.",

Public Health systems could leverage aggregated data for population health monitoring. Research platforms may utilize the standardized data for studies on physical activity and health outcomes.

Clinical Care Teams are the core users, driving the design with their need to track, manage, and prescribe physical activity. Patients and Caregivers are key users, as the IG emphasizes patient-centered care and their involvement in goal setting and care planning.  Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations have important, well-defined needs related to population health monitoring and intervention evaluation. Payers have a defined but limited role, primarily related to potential reimbursement of non-traditional services.
