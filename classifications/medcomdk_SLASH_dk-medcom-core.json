EHR systems are central to implementing this IG, as they manage and exchange the core data defined. Other systems like lab, pharmacy, and imaging systems will need to integrate with these core profiles to ensure seamless data flow. Public health systems may leverage this data for population health monitoring, while research platforms might use it for data analysis. Payer systems have minimal involvement, primarily needing to recognize the identifiers used. PHR systems may need to present data conforming to these profiles to patients.",
