It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it directly leverage CDA. While it integrates with other HL7 standards like the Clinical Genomics Reporting IG, this integration is primarily through FHIR, making the Cross-Paradigm score moderate.",

It leverages FHIR to enhance interoperability in cancer care, with a strong emphasis on representing core clinical observations, findings, and documentation related to cancer diagnosis, staging, genomics, treatment, and outcomes. While it touches upon other domains like **Research** and **Quality & Reporting**, these are secondary to its primary goal of establishing a common data model for clinical data exchange in oncology.",
