# uds-plus: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    The UDS+ IG aims to standardize and improve the process of submitting data from health centers to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Currently, health centers submit aggregated data in a tabular format through various methods like portals and SFTP. The UDS+ IG seeks to enable the submission of patient-level, de-identified data using FHIR APIs, increasing data granularity, timeliness, and quality for analysis by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC). This will allow for more detailed analysis, and improve efficiency, of the data being used by HRSA.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    The UDS+ IG improves upon previous approaches by transitioning from aggregated tabular data submissions to patient-level, de-identified data submissions via standardized FHIR APIs. This enhances data granularity, enabling more detailed analysis by HRSA. It aims to automate reporting, reducing provider burden, and improve data quality and timeliness. It also standardizes submission protocols and formats, addressing the variety of mechanisms currently in use, and allows for partial and incremental submissions.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features and technical approaches include:
    *   Defining FHIR API mechanisms for data access and exchange.
    *   Using the FHIR Bulk Data Access IG for retrieving population-level data.
    *   Employing SMART App Launch IG for Backend Services Authorization to secure system-to-system interactions.
    *   Defining a de-identification process to ensure patient privacy.
    *   Leveraging HL7 FHIR R4, US Core IG, QI Core IG, and DEQM IG.
    *   Supporting partial and incremental data submissions.
    *   Defining specific UDS+ profiles for resources like Patient, Encounter, Condition, Observation, etc.
    *   Using NDJSON as a file format for data exchange.
    *   Using a manifest file to specify the location of the data to be submitted.
    *   Using a specific set of operations like $import and $deidentify.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    The UDS+ IG aligns with existing standards and regulations, including:
    *   HL7 FHIR R4 standard.
    *   US Core IG, supporting United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v3.
    *   Bulk Data Access IG, supporting USCDIv3.
    *   SMART App Launch IG for Backend Services Authorization, supporting USCDIv3.
    *   QI Core IG and DEQM IG for quality measure reporting.
    *   ONC 2015 Edition, 2015 Edition Cures Update, and Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).
    *   HHS De-identification Guidance.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users and beneficiaries are:
    *   **Health Centers/HCCNs**: They benefit from a more standardized and efficient process for submitting UDS data, reducing reporting burden through automation.
    *   **EHR Vendors**: They need to implement the FHIR APIs and profiles specified in the IG, enabling them to support their health center clients.
    *   **HRSA (Bureau of Primary Health Care):** They gain access to more granular, timely, and high-quality patient-level data for analysis and program improvement.
    *   **Patients**: While not directly interacting with the IG, they benefit from improved data quality and analysis, potentially leading to better healthcare services and outcomes.
