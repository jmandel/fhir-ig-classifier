  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-nhsn-ade-ig\" focuses on enabling the reporting of inpatient adverse drug events (ADEs), specifically hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The IG defines the structure and content of FHIR resources used to represent patient-level data related to blood glucose levels, medication administrations, and diabetes diagnoses. This data is intended to be extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) and transmitted to NHSN for analysis and quality improvement purposes. The IG specifies two primary FHIR Composition resources: one for hypoglycemia and one for hyperglycemia. These compositions contain references to other FHIR resources, such as Patient, Encounter, Observation (for blood glucose results), MedicationAdministration, Condition (for diabetes and ESRD/ESLD diagnoses), and Procedure. The IG also includes examples of these resources in various formats (XML, JSON, TTL). The primary goal of this IG is to standardize the data model and exchange mechanisms for reporting ADEs related to glycemic control in inpatient settings. It leverages existing quality measures endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and aims to facilitate benchmarking and quality improvement efforts across hospitals. The IG is specifically designed for the U.S. healthcare context and targets EHR vendors, healthcare provider organizations, and public health agencies as its primary stakeholders.",
