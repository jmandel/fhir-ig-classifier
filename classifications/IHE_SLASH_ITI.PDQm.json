It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it directly leverage CDA. While it doesn't explicitly integrate multiple HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and its relationship to other IHE profiles that might use different HL7 standards suggests a minor level of cross-paradigm awareness.",

While it touches upon clinical data through patient demographics, its primary focus is not on deep clinical information exchange. Security is addressed through audit event requirements.",

Clinical Decision Support systems may utilize PDQm to ensure accurate patient context for alerts and guidance.
