  "rationale": "The fhir-mCODE-ig Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining a set of structured data elements for oncology electronic health records, specifically for representing the minimal common oncology data elements (mCODE). This IG defines numerous FHIR profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems tailored to oncology. \n\n- **Functional Domain:** The IG's content strongly aligns with \"Clinical Care > Specialty Care > Oncology\", as it defines profiles for cancer patients, primary and secondary cancer conditions, cancer stage, tumor markers, and various oncology-specific assessments. It also touches upon \"Research\" by enabling the collection of research-quality data. While it doesn't define specific administrative or financial processes, it references US Core, which does cover some of these areas, so a small score is given there.\n\n- **HL7 Standard:** The IG is explicitly based on FHIR R4, as indicated by the `fhirVersion` in the `sushi-config.yaml` file and the use of FHIR resources throughout the documentation. It also defines profiles based on US Core, which is also built on FHIR R4.\n\n- **Scope/Purpose:** The primary purpose of this IG is \"Data Modeling\", as it defines numerous profiles that specify the structure and content of oncology data. It also supports \"Data Exchange\" by providing capability statements for various exchange patterns. While it doesn't define specific workflows, the profiles and examples suggest support for clinical workflows. It also touches on \"Knowledge Representation\" by defining value sets and code systems for representing clinical concepts.\n\n- **Geographic Scope:** The IG is developed by HL7 International with a focus on the United States, as indicated by the `jurisdiction` field in the `sushi-config.yaml` file and the use of US Core profiles. However, it aims to be a standard that can be adopted internationally, so it also gets a small score for \"Universal Realm\".\n\n- **Stakeholders:** The IG is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including \"Healthcare Provider Organizations\" (especially clinical care teams), \"Technical Implementers\" (EHR vendors, system integrators), and \"Standards Organizations\". It also has implications for \"Public Health Organizations\" and \"Administrative Organizations\", although the focus is more on clinical data. The IG does not directly address patient-facing stakeholders, but the data collected could be used to improve patient care and engagement.\n\nIn summary, the fhir-mCODE-ig Implementation Guide is a comprehensive resource for representing oncology data using FHIR, with a strong emphasis on data modeling and support for clinical care and research.",
