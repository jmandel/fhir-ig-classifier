It heavily relies on FHIR for its structure and operations, with no significant dependence on other HL7 standards like CDA, v2, or v3. While it does not directly integrate different HL7 paradigms, it does align with other FHIR IGs, demonstrating a degree of cross-paradigm thinking within the FHIR ecosystem.",

It primarily targets EHR systems for capturing and managing both clinical and patient-reported outcomes.  Clinical research platforms will also play a key role in leveraging this standardized data.  Patient engagement through PHR systems is important for collecting patient-reported outcomes. Public health systems may utilize aggregated, de-identified data for population-level analysis. While not a primary focus, clinical decision support systems could potentially leverage the standardized outcomes data for tailored recommendations. Payer systems might use the outcomes data for value-based care models, but direct integration is not a core focus. Pharmacy and imaging systems have minimal direct involvement.",
