It heavily relies on FHIR resources and profiles, with no significant use of other HL7 standards like CDA, v2, or v3. While it doesn't directly integrate different HL7 paradigms, it does bridge FHIR versions (R5 and R6) through extensions, which could be considered a form of cross-paradigm work within the FHIR ecosystem.",

The primary goal is to facilitate the creation, sharing, and reuse of computable knowledge artifacts for clinical decision support, guideline development, and quality measurement. While it touches upon clinical data and workflow, its core is deeply rooted in representing clinical knowledge and research findings in a structured, computable format.",
