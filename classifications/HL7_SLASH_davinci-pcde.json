It leverages FHIR R4 and other Da Vinci IGs to define a document-centric approach, orchestrated by a Task resource, for sharing active treatment plans and supporting clinical data. While it touches upon administrative aspects and utilizes clinical data, its core purpose revolves around facilitating a smooth transition of care by providing the new payer with essential information about the patient's ongoing treatments and their coverage under the previous payer.",
