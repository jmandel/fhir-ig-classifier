EHR systems are central to this process, as they will be used to create and manage these plans. Payer systems are also key, as they will need to process claims related to eLTSS services. Case management systems, often used by state agencies, will play an important role in coordinating care and thus require extensive integration. PHR systems will be important for patient engagement, allowing them to access and potentially contribute to their care plans. Public health systems may utilize aggregated eLTSS data for population health monitoring, and clinical decision support systems can leverage eLTSS data to provide tailored guidance.
