  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-mmm-ig\" defines a framework for maternal health researchers to aggregate, calculate, and analyze clinical information related to maternal and child health, focusing on longitudinal maternal care. It leverages the Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) to define research populations and capture relevant clinical data. The IG specifies two initial use cases: 1) pregnancy and subsequent death within a specific timeframe, and 2) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It outlines how to link maternal and child records using the US Core Related Person profile and FHIR's Patient resource, emphasizing the importance of Master Patient Index (MPI) systems for managing patient identities across different data sources. The IG also addresses data exchange mechanisms, including point-in-time queries and research population creation, and provides guidance on data de-identification for research purposes. It references several existing standards, including US Core, Vital Records Common Profiles, and others related to perinatal clinical information. The IG defines a dataflow process involving the selection of a research measure, retrieval of clinical information from a data source, execution of the $evaluate-measure operation, and aggregation of data for mothers and their children. It also specifies requirements for data sources and consumers regarding must-support elements and handling of missing data. Finally, it touches upon privacy and security considerations, emphasizing the need for agreement on the scope of information exchange and adherence to applicable laws and policies.",
