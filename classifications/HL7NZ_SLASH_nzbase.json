  "rationale": "The `nzbase` FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining a set of New Zealand-specific extensions, profiles, and terminology artifacts for use within the FHIR framework. It establishes foundational elements for interoperability within the New Zealand healthcare context, rather than focusing on a specific clinical domain. The IG defines numerous extensions to represent NZ-specific data elements, such as ethnicity, domicile code, and various identifiers like the NHI. It also includes profiles for core FHIR resources like Patient, Practitioner, Location, and Organization, incorporating these extensions. The terminology section defines ValueSets and CodeSystems for NZ-specific codes, including ethnicity, iwi, and various administrative codes. The IG's scope is primarily data modeling, defining the structure and content of FHIR resources for the NZ context. It also touches upon data exchange by defining identifiers and providing guidance on their use. The geographic scope is explicitly limited to New Zealand, as indicated by the canonical URL, publisher information, and the content of the defined extensions and terminology. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, particularly EHR vendors and system integrators, who will use this IG to ensure their systems are compliant with NZ requirements. It also indirectly impacts healthcare provider organizations and public health agencies by standardizing data representation. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for use within the New Zealand healthcare system.",
