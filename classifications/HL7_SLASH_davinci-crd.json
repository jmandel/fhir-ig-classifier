    "summary": "The Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR, leveraging its RESTful API and resource model for exchanging coverage information. It heavily utilizes CDS Hooks, a specification built on top of FHIR, for real-time interactions. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, they are not central to its core functionality. The IG does not use v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it directly utilize CDA for document exchange. It does, however, demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm integration by building upon other FHIR-based IGs and specifications.",
