# ebm: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to standardize the representation and exchange of scientific knowledge related to evidence-based medicine (EBM) using FHIR. It provides a structured way to represent research findings, clinical guidelines, and related knowledge assets. The context is primarily for systems exchanging scientific knowledge within healthcare, academic, and research communities. The objective is to enable interoperability and reusability of EBM knowledge.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing FHIR resources and profiles for representing key aspects of EBM knowledge, such as citations, study designs, research findings, assessments, and recommendations. It introduces specific profiles for representing artifacts like journal articles, books, datasets, and even software, whereas previous approaches may not have provided such granularity. It provides a structured and extensible way to represent the complexities of scientific evidence, which is often absent in traditional approaches.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   Use of FHIR resources like `Evidence`, `EvidenceVariable`, `Citation`, `ArtifactAssessment`, `Composition`, and `Group` to represent various EBM components.
    *   Use of FHIR extensions to add more specific data elements to FHIR core resources.
    *   Profiles for specific use cases within EBM, such as `ComparativeEvidence`, `Recommendation`, `RiskOfBias`, `SummaryOfFindings`, `OutcomeImportance` and `M11Report`.
    *   Use of ValueSets to provide semantic interoperability for concepts used within the resources.
    *   Slicing and profiling to constrain the resources for specific use cases.
    *   Use of the `Composition` resource to structure reports combining various knowledge elements.
    *   Support for different types of citations, including books, journal articles, databases, datasets, software, and web pages.
    *   Support for complex statistical models through extensions on the Evidence Resource.
    *   Explicit expression of intended and observed variables in evidence.
    *   Explicit expression of study design and synthesis methods.
    *   Specific profiles for representing eligibility criteria and search strategies.
    *   Use of `Group` resource to represent cohorts, populations, and study groups.
    *   Use of `PlanDefinition` to represent implementable recommendations.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG is built on the HL7 FHIR standard, which is a core standard for healthcare data interoperability. It aims to support the exchange of information relevant to evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines, which are often referenced in healthcare regulations. By standardizing the representation of EBM knowledge, it can help improve the transparency and consistency of healthcare decision-making.  It is also intended to support data exchange for the ICH M11 Clinical Electronic Structured Harmonised Protocol.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    Primary users include:
    *   Developers of systems that manage and exchange evidence-based medicine knowledge.
    *   Researchers who collect and analyze study data.
    *   Guideline developers who create and disseminate clinical practice recommendations.
    *   Clinical decision support system developers who need structured evidence data.
    *   Individuals who contribute to scholarly publishing.
    *   Indirectly, patients can benefit from improved access to and quality of evidence-based healthcare.
