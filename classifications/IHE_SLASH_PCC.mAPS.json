While it references IHE profiles and uses a document-based exchange approach, it doesn't directly utilize CDA, v2, or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it builds upon the IPS, which itself may have connections to other HL7 standards, but this IG's focus is primarily within the FHIR paradigm.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on standardizing the exchange of antepartum care summaries. Its primary goal is to improve continuity of care for pregnant patients by enabling the sharing of comprehensive pregnancy-related data between healthcare providers.  Clinical care teams, particularly those specializing in obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine, are the core users, as the IG directly addresses their need for a structured and comprehensive summary of a patient's pregnancy. Public health agencies and research organizations also benefit from the standardized data for population health monitoring and research purposes. While patients may indirectly benefit from improved care coordination, their direct interaction with the IG is limited. Payers and healthcare administrators have a less direct role, primarily related to potential improvements in care efficiency and quality reporting.",
