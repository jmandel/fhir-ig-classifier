  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-qi-core\" defines a set of profiles, extensions, and value sets to support quality improvement activities. It primarily focuses on defining FHIR profiles that extend or are derived from US Core profiles, providing a standardized way to represent clinical data for quality measurement and decision support. \n\nThe IG includes numerous profiles for various clinical concepts like AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, Condition, Device, Encounter, Immunization, Medication, Observation, Procedure, and more. These profiles define constraints and extensions on base FHIR resources or US Core profiles to meet the specific needs of quality improvement. \n\nAdditionally, the IG defines extensions to capture additional data elements or semantics not covered by base FHIR or US Core. It also defines value sets to provide standardized terminologies for use within the profiles. The IG includes a mapping from the Quality Data Model (QDM) to QI-Core, facilitating the transition from QDM-based measures to FHIR-based measures. \n\nFurthermore, the IG provides guidance on representing negation, patterns of usage, and model information to support implementation using Clinical Quality Language (CQL). It also includes a change history, downloads for definitions and examples, and information on dependencies and cross-version analysis. \n\nIn summary, the \"fhir-qi-core\" IG focuses on defining the structure and content of FHIR resources for quality improvement, rather than specifying data exchange mechanisms, security protocols, or workflow support. It is primarily a data modeling effort, providing a common foundation for building interoperable quality-focused applications.",
