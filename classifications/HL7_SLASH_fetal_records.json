Its design is driven by the needs of clinical care teams involved in prenatal care and the IT developers supporting them. While other stakeholders like public health agencies and research organizations benefit from the standardized data, their influence on the IG's core design is less direct. Patients and caregivers are indirectly impacted through improved care coordination, but they are not a primary user group. Payers and healthcare administrators have minimal involvement.",
