Its primary goal is to facilitate the exchange of structured cancer data between healthcare providers and the national cancer registry. Therefore, it heavily emphasizes clinical data related to cancer diagnosis, staging, and basic patient information, with a strong reliance on established medical terminologies. While it touches upon administrative aspects for reporting and includes elements of workflow for data submission, its core is the detailed specification of clinical cancer data for registration purposes.",
