  "rationale": "The `cardx-htn-mng` FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining standards for representing and exchanging self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) data to improve hypertension management. It establishes FHIR profiles for individual SMBP readings, average SMBP readings, and associated heart rate measurements. These profiles are based on FHIR R4 and leverage existing FHIR resources like Observation and Patient. The IG also defines an extension for specifying the number of measurements used in calculating an average. \n\nThe IG's core functionality revolves around data modeling, specifying how SMBP data should be structured using FHIR resources and elements. It also touches upon data exchange by outlining scenarios where SMBP data is transmitted between devices, personal health intermediaries, and electronic health record (EHR) systems via FHIR APIs. The IG emphasizes the use of specific LOINC codes for blood pressure and heart rate measurements, and UCUM units for representing measurement values. \n\nWhile the IG mentions alignment with US Core, its primary focus is on defining its own profiles for SMBP. It also references external initiatives like CDC Million Hearts and Target: BP, but its core contribution is the creation of FHIR-based data models for SMBP. The IG is intended for a universal realm, but some examples and references suggest a slight lean towards the United States context. The primary stakeholders are clinical care teams who will use the standardized SMBP data for patient management, and EHR vendors who will implement the defined profiles and data exchange mechanisms.",
