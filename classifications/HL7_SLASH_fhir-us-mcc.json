It leverages FHIR's RESTful API and resource model, defining profiles, extensions, and interactions based on the FHIR R4 specification. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it does not directly utilize or integrate with CDA, v2, or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is limited to referencing other FHIR-based initiatives like US Core and the Gravity Project.",

While Patients and Caregivers are central to the care planning process, their role in driving the IG's design is less direct. Healthcare Administrators, Payers, Public Health Agencies, and Research Organizations benefit from the standardized data exchange enabled by the IG, but their influence on its core specifications is secondary. Government Agencies have a minimal role in this specific IG, primarily related to its alignment with broader US healthcare initiatives.",
