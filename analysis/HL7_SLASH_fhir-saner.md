# fhir-saner: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The FHIR IG "SANER" (Situational Awareness for Novel Epidemic Response) aims to standardize the exchange of public health data during epidemics, particularly focusing on hospital capacity reporting. It seeks to streamline how healthcare facilities report crucial information like bed availability, ventilator usage, and patient demographics to public health agencies. This real-time data exchange facilitates informed decision-making during emergencies.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

The provided files don't explicitly state how this IG improves upon past methods. However, its emphasis on FHIR, a modern interoperability standard, suggests a move towards more efficient and standardized data sharing compared to potentially less structured previous practices.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **FHIR-based:** The IG leverages FHIR resources like Measure, MeasureReport, CapabilityStatement, and ValueSet to define data structures and exchange mechanisms.
- **Transaction-oriented:** It outlines specific transactions like "Query Measure," "Produce Measure," "Compute Measure," and "Query Measure Definition" for data flow between actors.
- **Role-specific CapabilityStatements:** Defines distinct capabilities for actors like "Measure Source," "Measure Consumer," "Data Source," etc., ensuring clear responsibilities.
- **Standardized ValueSets:** Employs standardized terminologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC for consistent data representation.
- **Focus on automation:**  Promotes automated reporting through features like the "ReportingPeriod" extension and "MeasureExpectation" extension.
- **National Core Alignment:** Emphasizes using national healthcare information models for localization and compliance with country-specific standards.

## 4. Relation to Broader Standards and Regulations

The IG aligns with broader healthcare standards by utilizing FHIR, a widely recognized interoperability standard. It also explicitly calls for adherence to national core standards within different jurisdictions. While the files don't mention specific regulations, its focus on public health reporting suggests compliance with reporting mandates from agencies like the CDC.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Public Health Agencies:** Direct beneficiaries, gaining access to real-time data for situational awareness and response planning.
- **Healthcare Facilities:** Streamlined reporting processes through standardized data exchange.
- **Patients:** Indirectly benefit from more effective public health interventions and resource allocation during epidemics.
- **Software Developers:** Clear specifications facilitate the development of interoperable tools for data collection, analysis, and reporting.
