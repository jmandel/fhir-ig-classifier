# fhir-sirb: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

-   **Primary interoperability challenges this IG addresses:** This IG addresses the challenge of standardizing the exchange of research study forms and data between a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) and multiple relying research institutions. It replaces ad-hoc document transfers with a structured, FHIR-based approach.
-   **Key clinical/business problems it solves:** It aims to reduce the administrative burden, redundancy, and delays associated with obtaining ethics approvals for multi-site clinical research studies, as mandated by the revised Common Rule (45 CFR Part 46.114). It streamlines the process by establishing a single point of ethics review and standardizing the content and format of required forms.
-   **Intended scope and boundaries:** The scope is limited to the creation and exchange of seven core sIRB questionnaires (Determination Letter, Protocol, Consent Form, Recruitment Materials, Adverse Medical Events, Non-Medical Events, and Continuing Review) and an optional "Initiate a Study" questionnaire for pre-population. Data extraction from QuestionnaireResponses is out of scope but can be implemented using the SDC IG.

## Technical Foundation

-   **Core profiles and extensions:** The IG primarily uses the `Questionnaire` and `QuestionnaireResponse` resources. It leverages numerous SDC extensions for rendering (e.g., `rendering-style`, `rendering-xhtml`), display control (e.g., `choiceOrientation`, `displayCategory`, `hidden`, `itemControl`), and population logic (e.g., `answerExpression`, `initialExpression`, `calculatedExpression`, `launchContext`, `variable`). It also optionally uses the `ResearchStudy` and `Provenance` resources.
-   **Notable operations and interactions:** Key interactions involve retrieving `Questionnaire` resources via URL, retrieving `QuestionnaireResponse` resources by ID or search parameters, and submitting completed forms using POST. The `vread` interaction is highlighted for retrieving specific versions of `QuestionnaireResponse`. The `patch` interaction is allowed but optional.
-   **Key terminology and value sets:** The IG utilizes CodeSystems from the HL7 CodeSystems Registry where possible (e.g., `expandedYes-NoIndicator`, `ResearchStudyPhase`, `UCUM`, `relationship`, `ResearchStudyStatus`, `administrativeSex`, `Ethnicity`, `Race`, `AdverseEventSeriousness`, `AdverseEventSeverity`, `AdverseEventCausalityAssessment`, `actionTakenInResponseToTheEvent`). It also defines a temporary `CodeSystem` (`CodeSystem-temporarycodes.html`) for sIRB-specific concepts not covered by existing terminologies.
-   **Significant patterns and constraints:** The IG emphasizes a low technical barrier to entry, particularly for smaller relying sites. It assumes that institutions may not integrate the questionnaires with existing research management systems. The `Questionnaire` and `QuestionnaireResponse` resources are designed to be self-contained, with no required dependencies on other FHIR resources.

## Technical Essence

This IG defines a FHIR-based document exchange system for sIRB workflows centered around `Questionnaire` and `QuestionnaireResponse` resources. `Questionnaire` resources, heavily extended with SDC profiles for display and population logic, represent standardized sIRB forms. `QuestionnaireResponse` resources capture completed form data. A core design principle is client-side population, where an "Initiate a Study" `QuestionnaireResponse` pre-populates other forms using `answerExpression`, `initialExpression`, and `variable` extensions, leveraging `fhirpath` for calculations and context. The IG mandates support for basic RESTful interactions (GET, POST, PUT) on these resources, with specific search parameters defined in the Capability Statements. The optional use of `ResearchStudy` and `Provenance` is suggested for more robust implementations. The IG relies on existing HL7 CodeSystems where possible, supplementing them with a temporary `CodeSystem` for sIRB-specific concepts. The technical approach prioritizes simplicity and a low implementation burden, targeting institutions that may not have existing FHIR infrastructure.

## Implementation Approach

-   **Critical workflows and interactions:** The primary workflow involves the lead PI's institution hosting a FHIR server and client software. The client retrieves `Questionnaire` resources, renders them for completion, and submits `QuestionnaireResponse` resources to the server. Relying sites can interact with the forms through the host's client software or their own FHIR infrastructure. The IG outlines workflows for initial submission, site addition, continuing review, and reportable events.
-   **Important requirements and guardrails:** Compliant systems SHALL support the rendering, transmission, and storage of the eight sIRB `Questionnaire` resources and their corresponding `QuestionnaireResponse` resources. Editing and display of completed `QuestionnaireResponse` resources are also required. The IG specifies RESTful interactions and search parameters in the Capability Statements.
-   **Notable design choices and patterns:** The client-side population approach minimizes the need for server-side operations. The use of temporary codes anticipates future standardization efforts. The optional nature of the `ResearchStudy` resource reflects the focus on `Questionnaire` and `QuestionnaireResponse` as the primary records.

## Ecosystem Context

-   **Target systems and users:** The primary users are lead PIs, study coordinators, and IRB staff at both the sIRB and relying institutions. Target systems include research study management systems, sIRB software, and potentially smaller clinics or rural providers without dedicated FHIR infrastructure.
-   **Relationship to other standards/IGs:** The IG heavily relies on the [SDC IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/STU3/) for form rendering, behavior, and population logic. It also references the [FHIR R4 specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).
-   **Relevant jurisdictions or programs:** The IG is directly relevant to the "NIH Policy on the Use of a Single Institutional Review Board for Multi-Site Research" and the revised Common Rule in the United States.
-   **Primary use cases and scenarios:** The main use cases involve streamlining the submission, review, and approval of research study forms for multi-site clinical trials under a single IRB. This includes initial study submission, adding relying sites, conducting continuing reviews, and reporting adverse events.
