# au-fhir-base: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

-   **Primary interoperability challenges this IG addresses:** The AU Base Implementation Guide (IG) addresses the lack of standardization in representing Australian-specific healthcare concepts within FHIR. It tackles inconsistencies in identifying individuals and organizations, handling local terminologies, and representing demographic data unique to Australia.
-   **Key clinical/business problems it solves:** By providing a common foundation for Australian FHIR implementations, AU Base facilitates data exchange across different healthcare settings and systems within the country. It supports national initiatives like My Health Record and aims to improve the quality and consistency of health information.
-   **Intended scope and boundaries:** AU Base defines a set of base profiles, extensions, terminologies, and identifiers relevant to the Australian healthcare context. It is intended to be a foundational layer upon which other, more specific, IGs can be built. It does not constrain for specific use cases but rather provides building blocks. It explicitly avoids defining Must Support flags or mandating specific interactions, leaving those to downstream IGs like AU Core.

## Technical Foundation

-   **Core profiles and extensions:**
    -   **Profiles:** AU Base Patient, Practitioner, RelatedPerson, Organization, Location, Encounter, ServiceRequest, DiagnosticReport, Medication, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, MedicationAdministration, MedicationDispense, Immunization, Coverage, Substance, Procedure, BodyStructure, Composition, Specimen, AllergyIntolerance, Condition, Diagnostic Imaging Report, Diagnostic Imaging Result, Pathology Report, Pathology Result, Health Program Participation Summary, Assertion of No Relevant Finding, Medicine List.
    -   **Extensions:** Australian Veteran Status, Name Context, Person Recorded Sex or Gender, Individual Pronouns, Individual Gender Identity, Australian Indigenous Status, Date of Arrival in Australia, Address Identifier, Ahpra Profession Details, Ahpra Registration Details, Contact Purpose, Australian Time Zone, Result Copies To, Medication Brand Name, Medication Generic Name, Medication Strength, Medication Type, Change Description, Closing the Gap Registration, Dispense Number, Encryption Certificate PEM X509, Ethnicity, Identifier Routability, IHI Record Status, IHI Status, IHI Verified Date, Information Recipient, Long Term Medication, No Fixed Address, Subsidised Concurrent Supply, Vaccine Serial Number.
-   **Notable operations and interactions:** AU Base does not define specific operations or interactions, leaving that to downstream IGs.
-   **Key terminology and value sets:**
    -   **Value Sets:** Jurisdiction ValueSet - AU Extended, AU Recorded Sex or Gender (RSG) Source Document Type, AU Recorded Sex or Gender Type, Name Context, ActEncounterCode - AU Extended, Observation Category Codes - AU Extended, Australian Indigenous Status, Australian Pronouns, Australian Veteran Status, Australian States and Territories, Contact Purpose, Contact Relationship Type, DVA Entitlement, Encounter Type, Gender Identity Response, Healthcare Organisation Role Type, Location Type (Physical) - AU Extended, ServiceDeliveryLocationRoleType - AU Extended, Accession Number Type, Order Identifier Type, AU Time Zone.
    -   **Code Systems:** AU Recorded Sex or Gender Source Document Type, AU Recorded Sex or Gender Type, Name Context, ActCode AU, Contact Purpose, DegreeLicenseCertificate AU, Location Type (Physical) AU, Location Type AU, Observation Category Codes AU.
-   **Significant patterns and constraints:** AU Base primarily focuses on defining optionality rather than enforcing constraints. Cardinality is generally kept as defined in the core FHIR specification. Must Support flags are not used. Terminology bindings are often sliced to offer specific options relevant to Australia. Choice or repeating elements are often sliced to define specific profiling options.

## Technical Essence

AU Base establishes a common FHIR foundation for Australian healthcare by defining a comprehensive set of localized profiles, extensions, and terminologies without imposing strict constraints. It extends core FHIR resources like Patient, Practitioner, and Organization with Australia-specific identifiers (e.g., Medicare Card Number, HPI-I, HPI-O) and demographic data (e.g., Indigenous Status, Veteran Status) using extensions. It introduces extensions for concepts like Recorded Sex or Gender, Individual Pronouns, and Name Context, aligning with the Gender Harmony project. Terminology bindings leverage national standards like the Australian Medicines Terminology (AMT) and SNOMED CT Australian extension, while also defining new value sets and code systems for concepts like Jurisdiction, Contact Purpose, and Location Types specific to Australia. AU Base profiles often slice elements to offer multiple terminology options, enabling downstream IGs to enforce specific bindings as needed. Identifiers are profiled extensively, providing guidance on using HPI-O and ABN scoped identifiers for local systems. The IG deliberately avoids imposing strict cardinality or Must Support constraints, focusing on defining a broad set of optional building blocks for Australian healthcare interoperability.

## Implementation Approach

-   **Critical workflows and interactions:** AU Base does not define specific workflows but provides the foundation for common healthcare interactions like patient registration, provider identification, medication management, and diagnostic reporting, adapted to the Australian context.
-   **Important requirements and guardrails:** Implementers should use AU Base concepts where they exist instead of redefining them locally. Downstream IGs are expected to build upon AU Base, adding constraints and Must Support flags as needed for specific use cases.
-   **Notable design choices and patterns:** The IG emphasizes optionality and flexibility, providing a wide range of choices for representing Australian-specific concepts. It uses slicing extensively to offer multiple options for elements like identifiers and terminology bindings.

## Ecosystem Context

-   **Target systems and users:** The primary target systems are those operating within the Australian healthcare ecosystem, including hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, and government agencies. The target users are implementers and developers building FHIR-based solutions for these systems.
-   **Relationship to other standards/IGs:** AU Base is designed to be a foundational layer for other Australian FHIR IGs, such as AU Core, AU eRequesting, and AU Provider Directory. It aligns with international standards like the HL7 Gender Harmony project, International Patient Access, and International Patient Summary.
-   **Relevant jurisdictions or programs:** The IG is relevant to all Australian jurisdictions and supports national programs like My Health Record.
-   **Primary use cases and scenarios:** AU Base supports a wide range of use cases, including patient administration, electronic health records, medication management, diagnostic reporting, and public health surveillance, adapted to the Australian context.
