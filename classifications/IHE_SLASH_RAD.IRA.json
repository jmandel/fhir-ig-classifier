  "rationale": "The IHE RAD.IRA Implementation Guide defines a system for coordinating radiology reporting applications using FHIRcast. It specifies how applications can share context (e.g., the current patient, study, or report) and content (e.g., measurements, annotations) during a reporting session. \n\n**Functional Domain:** The guide primarily focuses on **Clinical Care**, specifically within the **Specialty Care** domain of **Radiology**. It defines mechanisms for sharing information between applications used in radiology reporting workflows, such as image display, report creation, and AI tools. It also touches upon **General Clinical Care** aspects like medication management and clinical decision support, as these can be integrated into the reporting workflow. While not its primary focus, the guide can indirectly support **Research** by enabling the collection and sharing of structured data during reporting. \n\n**HL7 Standard:** The guide explicitly states its use of **FHIR** as the underlying standard. It mentions the use of FHIR R5 for resources used in FHIRcast events, indicating a strong reliance on **FHIR R5**. However, the sushi-config.yaml file specifies FHIR version 5.0.0, which aligns with R5.\n\n**Scope/Purpose:** The guide's core purpose is to facilitate **Data Exchange** between radiology applications. It defines transactions for subscribing to reporting sessions, connecting to notification channels, opening/closing report contexts, updating report content, and selecting report content. It also defines **Data Modeling** aspects by specifying profiles for resources like DiagnosticReport, Patient, and ImagingStudy in the context of FHIRcast events. The guide supports **Workflow Support** by enabling applications to synchronize their behavior based on shared context and content. \n\n**Geographic Scope:** The guide is published by the IHE Radiology Technical Committee, which has a global scope. The `jurisdiction` element in the sushi-config.yaml file is set to a universal realm code, suggesting an intention for international use. However, the examples and some of the terminology used might be more aligned with the **United States** context.\n\n**Stakeholders:** The guide is relevant to various stakeholders, including **Healthcare Provider Organizations** (specifically clinical care teams and health system integration teams), **Technical Implementers** (like EHR vendors and system integrators), and **Standards Organizations**. The focus on radiology reporting makes it particularly important for clinical care teams involved in radiology workflows.",
