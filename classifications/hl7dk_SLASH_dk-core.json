It leverages FHIR resources and extends them with Denmark-specific identifiers and terminologies. It does not utilize or reference CDA, v2, or v3, focusing solely on the FHIR standard. While it references other standards like SNOMED CT and LOINC, these are integrated within the FHIR context, not as part of a cross-paradigm approach.",
