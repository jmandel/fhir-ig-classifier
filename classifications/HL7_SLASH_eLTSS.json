  "rationale": "The eLTSS FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining a standardized approach to representing and exchanging electronic Long-Term Services and Supports (eLTSS) data using FHIR. The core of this IG is the specification of FHIR profiles, extensions, and value sets to capture essential eLTSS data elements within a CarePlan. \n\nSpecifically, the IG defines new profiles for key FHIR resources like CarePlan, Condition, Goal, Observation, ServiceRequest, Claim, Contract, EpisodeOfCare, Location, Questionnaire, QuestionnaireResponse, and RiskAssessment. These profiles constrain and extend the base FHIR resources to align with the eLTSS data model, ensuring consistent representation of concepts like assessed needs, goals, strengths, preferences, services, providers, and signatures. \n\nAdditionally, the IG introduces new extensions, such as `resource-pertainstogoal`, to establish relationships between different resources and link activities to specific goals. It also defines new value sets for concepts like observation codes, condition categories, and service unit types, providing standardized terminology for eLTSS data. \n\nFurthermore, the IG provides detailed mapping guidance between the eLTSS data elements and the corresponding FHIR elements within the defined profiles. This mapping ensures interoperability and facilitates the exchange of eLTSS data between different systems. \n\nWhile the IG references other IGs like Gravity SDOH and MCC eCare Plan for supplementary guidance, its primary focus is on defining the core data model and exchange mechanisms for eLTSS data using FHIR. It also includes examples and testing guidance to aid implementers in adopting the specified profiles and extensions.",
