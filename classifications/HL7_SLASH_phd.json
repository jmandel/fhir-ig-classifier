It heavily relies on FHIR resources and profiles. While it acknowledges and maps data from IEEE 11073 standards, it doesn't directly use HL7 v2, v3, or CDA. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges the gap between IEEE 11073 and FHIR, but not within different HL7 standards.",
