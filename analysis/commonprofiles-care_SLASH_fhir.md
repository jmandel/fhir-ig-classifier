# fhir: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**
    This IG aims to standardize the exchange of healthcare information in Sweden by defining profiles for common FHIR resources like Patient, Practitioner, and Organization. It focuses on creating lightweight profiles for simple use cases and self-referral service requests. The context is the Swedish healthcare system, and it is intended for use by healthcare IT systems and applications. The goal is to enable interoperability between different systems by using common data structures and identifiers.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**
    The IG introduces specific profiles for Swedish healthcare, such as `OrganizationSECommonsLite`, `PatientSECommonsLite`, and `PractitionerSECommonsLite`, which are based on the Swedish base profiles. It also includes extensions like `HsaHierarchy` to represent the Swedish HSA catalog structure. The IG enforces specific identifier systems and formats, and includes invariants for `organisationsnummer`, `personnummer` and `samordningsnummer`,  ensuring data consistency and compliance with Swedish regulations. It also provides profiles for self-referral service requests and questionnaires, addressing specific Swedish healthcare workflows.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include:
    *   **Lightweight Profiles:** The "Lite" profiles are designed for minimal data exchange, focusing on essential elements.
    *   **Swedish Identifiers:** The profiles emphasize the use of HSA IDs, organization numbers, personal identity numbers, and coordination numbers, with specific format validation through invariants.
    *   **HSA Hierarchy Extension:** The `HsaHierarchy` extension describes the position of organizations within the Swedish HSA catalog.
    *   **Slicing and Pattern Matching:** The IG utilizes slicing on elements like `identifier` and `type` to create specific data structures.
    *   **Self-Referral Service Requests:**  A specific profile `ServiceRequestSelfReferralSECommonsLite` is defined for self-referrals, incorporating Swedish chief complaint codes.
    *   **Questionnaire Support:**  Profiles for questionnaires and questionnaire responses are included, with examples for structured data capture.
    *   **Mandatory Elements:** Specific elements such as `authoredOn` in `ServiceRequest` and `name` and `identifier` in `Organization` and `Patient` are marked as mandatory (1..) for data completeness.
    *   **Code System and Value Set Bindings:**  Use of SNOMED CT and other code systems with explicit versions and value sets are defined for controlled terminologies.
    *   **Examples:** Multiple examples of instances for each profile are provided for clarity and reference.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    The IG builds upon the HL7 FHIR standard, using its core resource types and extension mechanisms. It incorporates Swedish-specific requirements, such as the use of HSA IDs and the Swedish version of SNOMED CT, which are relevant to Swedish healthcare regulations and standards. The Patient Data Law (PDL), which is mentioned in the description of the `HsaHierarchy` extension, is also a relevant regulation this IG aims to address.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    Primary users include:
    *   **Healthcare IT system developers** who need to implement interoperable systems in Sweden.
    *   **Healthcare providers** who use systems that implement these profiles to exchange patient data.
    *   **Patients**, indirectly, who benefit from more efficient and standardized healthcare processes and communication through systems using this IG. The self-referral profile also directly impacts patients by facilitating their ability to seek care.
    *   **Organizations** that want to be uniquely identified in the Swedish healthcare system.
