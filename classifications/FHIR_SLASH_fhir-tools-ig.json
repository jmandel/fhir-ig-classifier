    "summary": "This IG is fundamentally about extending the FHIR IG Publisher to handle logical models and non-FHIR formats. It heavily relies on FHIR's StructureDefinition and extension mechanisms. While it acknowledges and aims to support the representation of formats like CDA, it doesn't directly implement CDA's core principles. It has minimal interaction with v2 or v3. Cross-paradigm integration is present in the sense that it bridges FHIR with other formats, but it's not a primary focus.",
