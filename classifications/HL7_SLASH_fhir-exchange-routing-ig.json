    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide primarily focuses on enabling transparent routing of FHIR RESTful interactions through intermediaries, essentially defining a workflow pattern for data exchange. It doesn't delve into specific clinical domains but rather provides a technical framework for how systems can communicate via intermediaries without the originator needing to be aware of the intermediary's presence. The IG emphasizes the use of a single public FHIR service base URL for the destination and a passive intermediary model. While it touches upon security by outlining a pass-through model, it doesn't define detailed security protocols. The IG is agnostic to specific clinical data, care planning, or diagnostic processes, focusing instead on the mechanics of FHIR interaction routing.",
