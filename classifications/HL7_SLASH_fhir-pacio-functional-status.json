    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on the standardized exchange of patient functional status information, particularly in post-acute care (PAC) settings and during transitions of care. It leverages FHIR R4 and builds upon US Core, utilizing Observation and QuestionnaireResponse resources to represent assessments and their results. The primary goal is to improve care coordination, quality measurement, and research by enabling seamless sharing of functional status data (mobility, self-care, domestic life) across different healthcare settings. While driven by the IMPACT Act in the US, the IG aims for broader applicability.",

Clinical Care Teams, especially those involved in PAC and transitions of care, are the primary drivers. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations also have a significant stake due to the IG's support for quality measurement and research. Payers and Government Agencies have a moderate interest, primarily due to the IMPACT Act and the need for standardized data. Patients and Caregivers benefit from improved care coordination, but their direct involvement in the IG's design is limited. Healthcare Administrators have a minimal role, primarily focused on system implementation.",
