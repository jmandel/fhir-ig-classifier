  "rationale": "The `dk-medcom-core` Implementation Guide primarily defines a set of core FHIR profiles for use within the Danish healthcare system, specifically tailored for MedCom standards. These profiles include `MedComCorePatient`, `MedComCoreOrganization`, `MedComCoreEncounter`, `MedComCoreCareTeam`, `MedComCorePractitioner`, `MedComCorePractitionerRole`, `MedComCoreObservation`, `MedComCoreDiagnosticReport`, and `MedComCoreMedia`. The guide also defines extensions like `MedComCoreContactExtension`, `MedComCoreDateTimeExtension`, `MedComCoreIdentifierExtension`, `MedComCorePractitionerExtension`, and `MedComCoreSenderExtension`. These profiles and extensions are designed to constrain and extend the base FHIR resources to meet the specific needs of the Danish context, such as including SOR identifiers for organizations and CPR numbers for patients. The guide also provides examples of how these profiles can be used. The focus is on data modeling, defining the structure and content of these core resources. While the guide does mention the use of these profiles in MedCom messaging standards, it does not define specific data exchange mechanisms or workflows. The guide is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for use within Denmark, as indicated by the jurisdiction and references to Danish standards and organizations. It is primarily aimed at technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, who will be implementing these profiles in their systems. The guide also has relevance for healthcare provider organizations, particularly their IT and integration teams, who will need to understand these profiles for data exchange and interoperability purposes. The guide is published by MedCom, a Danish organization responsible for healthcare IT standards.",
