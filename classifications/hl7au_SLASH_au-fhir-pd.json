    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on creating a provider directory for secure messaging in Australia. It heavily relies on FHIR resources and interactions, with minimal acknowledgment of other HL7 standards. The IG profiles core FHIR resources and defines specific search parameters to facilitate the discovery of healthcare providers and their secure messaging endpoints. While it mentions HL7 V2 for formatting in a specific context, it does not integrate with CDA or V3 models.",

It primarily addresses the administrative aspects of identifying and locating healthcare providers and services, leveraging FHIR resources like Organization, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, HealthcareService, Location, and Endpoint. While it touches upon clinical data through references to secure messaging of clinical documents, its core purpose is to facilitate the exchange of provider information to enable secure communication, rather than to define the content of that communication. Identity and security are also key, as the IG deals with secure messaging endpoints and associated identifiers.",
