# kl-term: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the use of codes for various healthcare and social care concepts within Danish municipalities. It provides a common set of terminologies for conditions, observations, interventions, and other relevant data points used in local government services. It's designed to improve interoperability and data exchange between different systems and providers within the Danish municipal context.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG provides a structured and standardized approach to representing data using FHIR CodeSystems and ValueSets. It consolidates codes from different sources (FSIII, FFB, SNOMED CT, NPU), creating a unified terminology for Danish municipalities. It moves away from potentially inconsistent, locally defined terminologies toward a more standardized approach.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   Use of FHIR CodeSystem and ValueSet resources to define terminologies.
    *   Inclusion of codes from multiple sources (FSIII, FFB, SNOMED CT, NPU).
    *   Hierarchical organization of ValueSets, including codes from other ValueSets.
    *   Use of "include codes from system where concept descendent-of" to define ValueSets based on hierarchical relationships.
    *   Definition of ValueSets for specific domains such as home care, nursing, therapy, prevention, and FFB (a Danish framework).
    *   Use of aliases for commonly used OIDs and URLs.
    *   Specific ValueSets for observations, severities, change values, interventions, and other relevant concepts.
    *   Defines a parameters instance for SNOMED CT expansions.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG uses FHIR, a widely accepted healthcare interoperability standard. It also incorporates SNOMED CT, an international clinical terminology. By using these standards, the IG aims to align with broader healthcare data exchange practices and regulations. It also references specific Danish frameworks (FSIII and FFB).

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are likely to be:
    *   Software developers building systems for Danish municipalities.
    *   Healthcare and social care professionals working within Danish municipalities.
    *   Data analysts and researchers working with municipal data.
    While patients are not directly using the IG, they are indirect beneficiaries of the improved data quality and interoperability, as it can support better care coordination and service delivery.
