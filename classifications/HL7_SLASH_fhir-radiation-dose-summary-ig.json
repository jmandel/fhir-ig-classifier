  "rationale": "The FHIR Radiation Dose Summary IG is focused on standardizing the sharing of minimal radiation information following a performed exam, particularly for diagnostic procedures. It defines a set of FHIR profiles and extensions to represent radiation dose data, including contextual information like the patient, device, and authorizing practitioner. The IG also specifies actors involved in the exchange of radiation dose information, such as the Radiation Dose Summary Producer, FHIR Server, and Radiation Dose Summary Consumer. \n\nThe core functionality of this IG revolves around defining FHIR resources and profiles. Specifically, it defines the `RadiationDoseSummary` profile, which is based on the FHIR `Observation` resource, to capture the essential radiation dose data. It also defines the `RadiationSummaryReport` profile, based on the FHIR `Composition` resource, to provide a more comprehensive report that includes indications and pregnancy status. Additionally, it defines the `ModalityDevice` profile, based on the FHIR `Device` resource, to represent the specific characteristics of the imaging modality. The IG also defines several value sets and code systems to ensure consistent terminology usage. \n\nIn terms of data exchange, the IG outlines the interactions between the actors using FHIR operations like `POST`, `GET`, and `search`. It specifies the capability statements for each actor, detailing the required FHIR operations and search parameters. The IG also provides test scripts and sample resources to facilitate implementation and validation. \n\nGeographically, the IG references multiple national jurisdictions, including France, Finland, and the United States (California), indicating its relevance to these regions. However, it also uses the Universal Realm code (001) for jurisdiction, suggesting an intention for broader applicability. \n\nRegarding stakeholders, the IG is primarily aimed at technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and device manufacturers, who are responsible for implementing the FHIR profiles and ensuring interoperability. It also targets healthcare provider organizations, particularly clinical care teams and radiology information systems (RIS), which need to access and utilize radiation dose information. Public health organizations may also benefit from the standardized data for surveillance and research purposes.",
