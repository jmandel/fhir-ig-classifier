However, it also acknowledges and supports international needs by incorporating international concepts for work schedule, employment status, and work classification. Therefore, it is classified as a National guide with some consideration for broader applicability.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on defining a standardized way to represent and exchange Occupational Data for Health (ODH). It primarily aims to improve clinical care, population health, and public health reporting by providing structured information about patients' work. While it touches upon administrative aspects by capturing employer information, its core purpose is not administrative. It emphasizes clinical data related to work and its impact on health, and it has a strong connection to public health by facilitating the reporting and analysis of occupational health trends. The IG is designed to be integrated into broader IGs and is not intended for billing or financial purposes.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on defining a standardized way to represent Occupational Data for Health (ODH) using FHIR. Its core technical approach relies heavily on defining data profiles for Observation resources to capture various aspects of occupational history. While it mentions the use of a composition, it's not intended as a standalone document. Terminology plays a significant role, with both US-specific and international value sets defined. The IG primarily supports RESTful interactions for retrieving ODH data, but doesn't define specific services or messaging patterns. It does not cover forms, UI, decision support, or subscriptions.",
