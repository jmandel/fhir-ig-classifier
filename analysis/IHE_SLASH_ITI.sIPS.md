# ITI.sIPS: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?**
    The IHE sIPS Implementation Guide (IG) aims to enable the sharing of International Patient Summary (IPS) documents using IHE Document Sharing mechanisms. The context is the exchange of essential healthcare information, particularly for unplanned, cross-border care, but it is not limited to this context. It is for healthcare providers and systems that need to share patient summaries, and for systems that need to consume the IPS documents. It does not modify the HL7 IPS specification, but focuses on the sharing infrastructure.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?**
    This IG provides a specific method for sharing IPS documents using IHE Document Sharing, which includes options like XDS, XDM, XDR, XCA, MHD, and MHDS. It maps the FHIR Composition resource elements from the IPS to Document Sharing metadata (DocumentEntry/DocumentReference), as specified in PCC Volume 2: 4.1. This allows the use of existing Document Sharing networks to exchange IPS documents. It also addresses the need to support both JSON and XML encodings of the IPS document by indicating transforms between multiple document entries that differ only in mime-type. It also specifically addresses how to use the "On-Demand" document sharing capability with IPS. It also provides more specific guidance on how to map the IPS document to the Document Sharing metadata.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**
    Key features include the use of IHE Document Sharing infrastructure to communicate IPS documents, mapping of FHIR IPS Composition to Document Sharing metadata (DocumentReference), support for both JSON and XML mime-types of the IPS Bundle, and guidance for "On-Demand" document sharing. The IG specifies the use of the IPS Bundle Profile canonical URI (`{{site.data.fhir.hl7ips}}/StructureDefinition/Bundle-uv-ips`) as the `formatCode`. It also uses `urn:ietf:rfc:3986` as the system for the formatCode. The IG also defines two actors: Content Creator and Content Consumer. It uses examples based on the IPS examples provided in the HL7 IPS Implementation Guide.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**
    This IG builds upon the HL7 International Patient Summary (IPS) standard and the IHE Document Sharing framework. It references the ISO 27269 standard that specifies the IPS data model. It leverages existing IHE profiles and standards for document sharing, such as XDS, XCA, XDR, XDM, MHD, and MHDS. It is designed to be content agnostic, so it can support any past or future document specifications, which enables existing networks to support the IPS without modification. It provides a mapping from FHIR Composition to XDS DocumentEntry attributes as defined in PCC TF-2:4.1.1. It also references the FHIR core DocumentReference mapping from Composition.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**
    The primary users are healthcare providers and systems that need to exchange patient summaries. This includes those creating (Content Creator) and those consuming (Content Consumer) IPS documents. Ultimately, patients benefit from improved information exchange when they receive care, especially in unplanned or cross-border scenarios, as the IPS provides a summary of their medical history.
