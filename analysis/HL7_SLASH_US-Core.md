# US-Core: Analysis

## Core Purpose & Scope

The US Core Implementation Guide (IG) addresses the primary interoperability challenge of establishing a common, implementable set of FHIR profiles and RESTful interactions to facilitate the exchange of patient data within the US Realm. It solves key clinical and business problems by defining a minimum baseline for accessing, exchanging, and using structured electronic health information, including patient demographics, medications, allergies, lab results, vital signs, and clinical notes. The intended scope is to provide a foundation for US-specific implementation guides, supporting the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard and enabling ONC Health IT Certification. The guide's boundaries are set by focusing on core data elements and interactions deemed essential for basic interoperability, leaving more specialized use cases to be addressed by other IGs.

## Technical Foundation

The technical foundation of US Core rests upon FHIR R4 and is built using a set of core profiles derived from base FHIR resources. These profiles include Patient, Observation (with specialized profiles for laboratory results, vital signs, and smoking status), MedicationRequest, Condition, AllergyIntolerance, Immunization, Procedure, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Goal, CarePlan, CareTeam, Encounter, Location, Organization, Practitioner, and PractitionerRole. Key extensions defined include US Core Race, Ethnicity, Birth Sex, and Provenance. Notable operations include the `$docref` operation for retrieving clinical notes. Interactions are primarily based on FHIR's RESTful API, emphasizing search and read operations. The guide heavily utilizes standard terminologies such as LOINC, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, and CPT, with value sets sourced from the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). Significant patterns include the use of `MustSupport` flags to indicate required elements, slicing to differentiate elements within repeating elements, and specific guidance on handling missing data and representing "entered in error" information.

## Technical Essence

US Core establishes a baseline for FHIR interoperability in the US by defining a set of constrained profiles built upon FHIR R4 resources, primarily focused on read access via RESTful interactions. Each profile specifies mandatory and *Must Support* elements, extensions, and terminology bindings, often leveraging standard code systems like LOINC, SNOMED CT, and RxNorm. For instance, the US Core Patient profile mandates support for elements like `identifier`, `name`, `telecom`, `gender`, and `birthDate`, while also incorporating extensions for race, ethnicity, and birth sex. The guide emphasizes the use of specific search parameters for each resource, such as `_id`, `patient`, `category`, and `date`, to facilitate standardized data retrieval. The `$docref` operation enables access to clinical notes, while specific profiles like US Core Laboratory Result Observation and US Core Vital Signs define how to represent and query various types of clinical data. The guide also provides detailed guidance on handling missing data, representing "entered in error" information, and using provenance resources to track data origin. The CapabilityStatement resource is used to declare conformance to specific profiles and supported interactions.

## Implementation Approach

Implementation of US Core involves adopting the defined profiles and implementing the specified RESTful interactions. Servers are expected to populate all mandatory and *Must Support* elements, while clients must be able to process these elements. The guide emphasizes the use of logical FHIR IDs for referencing resources and provides specific guidance on handling coded elements, including the use of "unknown" codes when data is missing. The `_lastUpdated` search parameter is recommended for tracking changes, and servers should document their support for this parameter in their CapabilityStatement. The guide also provides detailed instructions on using the `$expand` operation to discover supported note and report types and formats. Implementers should be aware of the distinction between "Profile Only Support" and "Profile Support + Interaction Support" and declare their conformance accordingly.

## Ecosystem Context

US Core targets US-based healthcare systems, including EHRs, HIEs, care coordination platforms, and patient-facing applications. It is designed to align with the USCDI standard and supports ONC Health IT Certification requirements. The guide builds upon the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide and is intended to be a foundation for other US Realm IGs. It is relevant to jurisdictions and programs within the United States, particularly those involved in health information exchange and regulatory compliance. Primary use cases include accessing patient demographics, medications, allergies, lab results, vital signs, clinical notes, and other core clinical data to support care coordination, transitions of care, quality reporting, and patient engagement. The guide also addresses security and privacy considerations, mandating the use of TLS 1.2 or higher and recommending conformance with HIPAA and NIST security standards.
