It utilizes US Core profiles and aims to be compatible with other FHIR-based IGs. While it acknowledges CDA and mentions its use in content IGs, it doesn't deeply integrate with it. The IG does not use v2 or v3 standards. It demonstrates a cross-paradigm approach by integrating FHIR with other standards like SMART on FHIR and Bulk Data Access, and by aiming for compatibility with other IGs like eCR.",

While it touches upon clinical data and workflow, its primary drive is enabling data exchange for public health and research, with a strong emphasis on defining the process and rules (clinical knowledge) for that exchange.",
