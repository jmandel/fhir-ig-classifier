# dk-core: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The "dk-core" FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to establish a standardized foundation for using FHIR in the Danish healthcare system. It provides a set of core profiles, extensions, terminologies, and examples tailored to the specific needs and regulations of the Danish healthcare context.

The IG is intended for a broad audience involved in developing and implementing FHIR-based systems in Denmark, including:

- **Software developers:** Building systems for various healthcare domains (e.g., primary care, hospitals, municipalities).
- **Standards organizations:** Ensuring interoperability and alignment with national regulations.
- **Healthcare professionals:** Understanding how FHIR can represent and exchange patient data in a Danish context.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

While the IG does not explicitly mention previous approaches, it addresses interoperability challenges by:

- **Standardizing common data elements:** Profiles constrain core FHIR resources to ensure consistent representation of key concepts like patient identifiers, organization types, and observation codes.
- **Introducing Danish-specific extensions:** Extends FHIR resources with elements necessary for local use, such as municipality codes and regional subdivision codes.
- **Providing Danish translations:** Supplements core FHIR code systems with Danish language designations to improve usability and understanding.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

- **Profiling:** Constraints core FHIR resources (e.g., Patient, Organization, Observation) with specific rules, value sets, and cardinality limits relevant to the Danish context.
- **Extensions:** Introduces custom extensions to capture Danish-specific data elements not present in the base FHIR specification.
- **Terminology binding:** Specifies value sets and code systems for key data elements, drawing upon both international standards (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT) and Danish national terminologies (e.g., NPU, MedCom).
- **Slicing:** Enables the use of multiple code systems within a single data element, promoting flexibility and accommodating different use cases.
- **Examples:** Provides concrete instances of profiled resources and bundles to illustrate correct implementation.

## 4. Relation to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

The IG demonstrates a strong alignment with Danish healthcare standards and regulations:

- **CPR and eCPR:** Adheres to requirements for handling Danish civil registration numbers (CPR) and replacement CPR numbers (eCPR).
- **SOR and FK-ORG:** References national registries for healthcare organizations (SOR) and public sector organizations (FK-ORG) for identifier management.
- **Danish Address Standard:** Acknowledges the Danish address standard and provides guidance on mapping FHIR address elements.
- **Data Protection:** Emphasizes the importance of data protection and security, including support for name and address confidentiality.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

- **Patients:** Benefit from improved data exchange and interoperability, leading to better continuity of care and more efficient healthcare services.
- **Healthcare professionals:** Can utilize standardized data models and terminologies for consistent documentation and communication.
- **Software developers:** Gain clear guidance for building interoperable FHIR-based systems in the Danish healthcare ecosystem.
- **Healthcare organizations:** Achieve greater efficiency and data sharing capabilities through the adoption of standardized FHIR profiles.
- **Standards organizations:** Contribute to the development and maintenance of the IG, ensuring its ongoing relevance and alignment with national regulations.
