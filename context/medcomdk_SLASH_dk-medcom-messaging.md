### Introduction

This Implementation Guide (IG) is provided by MedCom to describe the use of FHIR &reg;&copy; in message based exchange of data in Danish healthcare.

The IG contains profiles which are used to define a general messaging model for MedCom messages, like [HospitalNotification](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/hospitalnotification/), [CareCommunication](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/carecommunication/) and [Acknowledgement](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/acknowledgement/). 

#### General Messaging Model

The figure below illustrates a general messaging model, which all MedCom messages will comply to. Messaging profiles are all prefixed "MedComMessaging". Beside the profiles on the figure, a MedCom message will also include some MedComCore profiles and profiles made to support a specific use case. All together they constitute the actual content of a MedCom message. The following sections describe the overall purpose of each messaging profile.

<img alt="Shows the general MedCom messaging model. Each message must at least contain the following resources: Bundle, MessageHeader, Organization and Provenance." src="./MessagingModel.png" style="float:none; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />

##### MedComMessagingMessage

A Bundle resource defined to be of the type 'message'. All profiles included in a message shall be referenced from the entry element in the MedComMessagingMessage profile, with a MessageHeader as the first resource. 

__Note:__ Be aware that entries in a message in general are unordered. Recipients of a message cannot assume any sequences of profiles.

##### MedComMessagingMessageHeader

The MessageHeader defines the sender and receiver organization of a message. In some messages it is optional to include a one or more carbon-copy receiver organization(s). From the focus element is the actual content of the message often referenced, like a Communication or Encounter resource. 

##### MedComMessagingOrganization

This profile inherits from MedComCoreOrganization and is used to describe a sender and receiver organization. The resource constrains the MedComCoreOrganization profile to contain both a SOR identifier and an EAN identifier (also known as GLN) for addressing purposes.

##### MedComMessagingProvenance

The Provenance resource describes the activity of the message and who has triggered the message. Further is it used to describes the history of message activities e.g., if the message is related to a previously exchanged message. 

#### Terminology
On [MedCom Terminology IG](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/terminology/) all referenced CodeSystem and ValueSets developed by MedCom can be found.

#### Dependencies
This IG has a dependency to the [MedComCore IG](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/core/) and [DK-core](https://hl7.dk/fhir/core/) v. 2.0.0, defined by [HL7 Denmark](https://hl7.dk/). This is currently reflected in MedComMessagingOrganization which inherits from MedComCoreOrganization. 

### Documentation

[More information about MedCom Messaging](https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-messaging/) can be found here. MedComMessaging profiles does not alone constitute a standard, why the documentation is limited.

### Governance

FHIR profiles are managed under MedCom: [Source code](https://github.com/medcomdk/dk-medcom-messaging). 

A description of [governance concerning change management and versioning](https://medcomdk.github.io/MedComLandingPage/#4-change-managment-and-versioning) of MedComs FHIR artefacts, can be found on the link.

#### Quality Assurance Report

In the Quality Assurance report (QA-report) for this IG, there is an error with the following description: *Reference is remote which isn’t supported by the specified aggregation mode(s) for the reference (bundled)*. The error occurs when creating instances of the profiles and is due to some elements having a Bundled flag {b}, however the referenced profile is not included in a Bundle in an instance, since the instance only represents a part of the entire message. This should not influence the implementation by IT-vendors.

### Contact

[MedCom](https://www.medcom.dk/) is responsible for this IG.

If you have any questions, please contact <fhir@medcom.dk> or write to MedCom's stream in [Zulip](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/315677-denmark.2Fmedcom.2FFHIRimplementationErfaGroup).

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-message-definition-fhir-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This MessageDefinition profile is included to support FHIR messages. This profil inherits requirements in [MedComMessagingMessageDefinition](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/messaging/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-messagedefinition.html) and further constrain these to support FHIR messages.

---

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-message-definition-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This MessageDefinition profile defines the characteristics of a message that can be shared between systems, including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be transmitted and what response(s) are permitted. This profile should not be included in the exchange of a message, but can be used to extract relevant information concerning the message for usage in an envelope. The MedComMessagingMessageHeader profile includes a url to this profile in the element MessageHeader.definition.

---

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-message-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This profile describes the Bundle resource that shall be used in all MedCom FHIR Messages. MedComMessagingMessage is the root in all messages, as shown on the figure below. As this profile is the used in a message, shall the element type in MedComMessagingMessage always be *message*. This entails that the first resource in the entry element shall be a MedComMessagingMessageHeader. 

For each messaging standard e.g., HospitalNotification or CareCommunication is a different set of profiles defined, but common to them both is that all included profiles shall be referenced from the entry element. Due to the different requirements for each standard, it should be expected that the MedComMessagingMessage is inherited in each standard. 

<img alt="Shows the general MedCom messaging model. Each message must contain the following resources: Bundle, MessageHeader, Organization and Provenance." src="./MessagingModel.png" style="float:none; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />

Please refer to the tab "Snapshot Table(Must support)" below for the definition of the required content of a MedComMessagingMessage.


---

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-messageHeader-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This profile describes the MessageHeader resource that shall be used in all MedCom FHIR Messages. A MedComMessagingMessageHeader shall include a sender and receiver and it may include a carbon-copy receiver, however this is depended on type of standard. Each MedComMessagingMessageHeader shall include a globally unique id, which is used to describe the message history from the [MedComMessagingProvenance](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/messaging/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-provenance.html) profile. 

The element event shall be defined in accordance with the type of standard the message concerns e.g., HospitalNotification and CareCommunication. Due to the different requirements for each standard, it should be expected that the MedComMessagingMessageHeader is inherited in each standard. 

<img alt="Shows the MedComMessageHeader, which references the MedComMessagingOrganization as a sender, reciever and carbon-copy." src="./MedComMessageHeader.png" style="float:none; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />

Please refer to the tab "Snapshot Table(Must support)" below for the definition of the required content of a MedComMessagingMessageHeader.


---

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-organization-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This profile describes the Organization resource that shall be used in all MedCom FHIR Messages. MedComMessagingOrganization inherits from [MedComCoreOrganization](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-organization.html) as it shall include both a SOR and EAN/GLN identifier. MedComMessagingOrganization is used to describe the sender and receiver organizations of a all MedCom FHIR Messages.

Please refer to the tab "Snapshot Table(Must support)" below for the definition of the required content of a MedComMessagingOrganization.


---

// File: input/pagecontent/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-provenance-intro.md

### Scope and usage 

This profile is used as the Provenance resource for MedCom FHIR messages. The Provenance resource tracks information about the activity what was created, revised, or deleted, while referencing the current message and previous messages if such exist. This is why the Provenance resource is valuable in MedCom messaging.

MedComMessagingProvenance describes the activity and history of a message. The element Provenance.agent.who contains information about the organisation that was involved in the activity, the element Provenance.target references the MessageHeader in the current message, and the element Provenance.what references the event that initiated a message e.g., a previous message. 

The figure below illustrates the references from the Provenance resource.

<img alt="MedComMessagingProvenance handles information about the involved organization in the element *who*, references the MessageHeader related to current message in the element *target*, and references to the event that initiated a message in the element *what*." src="./MedComMessagingProvenance.png" style="float:none; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />
 

Please refer to the tab "Snapshot Table(Must support)" below for the definition of the required content of a MedComMessagingProvenance.

#### Activity

In MedCom messaging, the Provenance.target shall always be a reference to a [MedComMessagingMessageHeader](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/messaging/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-messageHeader.html) or an inherited of MedComMessagingMessageHeader. 
The target references the resources on which the activity has occurred. For instances if Provenance.activity is 'new-message', it describes that the message referenced from the Messageheader is a new message. 

The activitycodes used to describe the activity of the MedCom message may differ between standard e.g. [HospitalNotification](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/hospitalnotification/) and [CareCommunication](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/carecommunication/). Due to the different requirements of activities in a standard, it should be expected that there will be different invariants pointing at specific ValueSets for the given standard.

Provenance.agent describes the actor who is responsible for the activity that took place, by referencing the organisation responsible for the activity. The referenced organisation shall be an [MedComMessagingOrganization](http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/messaging/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-organization.html).

#### History

MedComMessagingProvenance handles the message history in the Provenacne.entity element. This element shall be included if the message is a response to a previous message. In this case the element Provenance.entity.role is used to describe how the entity is used in the message. Provenance.entity.role shall be: 
* *revision* when a message is a response, a correction, or a forwarding.
* *removal* when the message is a cancellation of a previously send message.

When a message is a response to a previous message, the previous message shall be referenced from the element Provenance.entity.what. The reference depends on the type of the previous message, which can be a MedCom FHIR message or a EDIFACT/OIOXML message. In the latter case, the reference shall be [lokationsnummer]#[brevid].

#### Timestamps

In MedComMessagingProvenance there are two timestamps, that represents the date and time the message was sent but in two different ways. Provenance.occuredDateTime is a human readable date and time and Provenance.recorded is a machine readable date and time.
