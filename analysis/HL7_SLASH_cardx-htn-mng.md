1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to improve the management of hypertension by standardizing the way self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) data is captured and exchanged between patients, devices, health management platforms, and clinical systems. It provides a common standard for interoperability in cardiovascular health and healthcare, specifically focusing on data generated outside of clinical settings. The objective is to make SMBP data more readily available for clinicians, leading to better hypertension diagnosis, management, and outcomes.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** The IG addresses the lack of interoperable health information technology that has been a barrier to SMBP implementation. By creating standardized FHIR profiles for SMBP, average SMBP, and associated heart rate, it enables consistent and computable data exchange. This contrasts with previous approaches where clinical information was often captured in unstructured documents within siloed platforms. This allows for the collection and sharing of real-world patient clinical data to inform clinical decision-making, evaluate quality and performance, support participation in clinical registries, and contribute to new discovery.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** The IG defines FHIR profiles (SelfMeasuredBloodPressure, AverageSMBP, and SMBPAssociatedHeartRate) and an extension (NumberOfMeasurements). It specifies the use of LOINC codes for identifying observations and UCUM for units of measure. It also defines value sets for Observation status and numeric result interpretation. The IG leverages FHIR's RESTful API for data exchange between systems and defines capability statements for both servers and clients. It also specifies "must support" rules for data elements which mandates that certain elements must be populated, exchanged, and supported by systems.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** The IG aligns with FHIR R4 and is designed to harmonize with existing standards and guidelines in cardiovascular care. It is based on the FHIR core profiles for Blood Pressure and Heart Rate. It also aligns with US Core, Vital Signs with Qualifying Elements, and the Personal Health Device IG. The IG is also influenced by initiatives like the CDC Million Hearts 2027 Optimizing Care Initiative, AHA's National Hypertension Council Initiative, and Target: BP.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users and beneficiaries include:
    *   **Patients:** Individuals with hypertension using SMBP devices, who will benefit from better management of their condition and increased engagement with clinicians.
    *   **Clinicians:** Physicians and other healthcare providers who will have access to more complete and accurate SMBP data, enabling them to make more informed treatment decisions and monitor therapeutic changes.
    *   **Device Manufacturers:** Companies producing SMBP devices who can leverage the standardized profiles to ensure their data can be easily integrated with other systems.
    *   **Personal Health Intermediary Platforms:** These platforms can use the standardized profiles to collect, aggregate, and manage SMBP data and then pass that data to EHRs.
    *   **EHR Vendors:** EHR systems that can use the standardized profiles to integrate SMBP data into patient records and workflows.
    *   **Researchers:** Those who can access standardized data for quality improvement, performance measurement, and new discovery.
