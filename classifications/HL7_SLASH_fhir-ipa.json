  "rationale": "The International Patient Access (IPA) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines a set of FHIR profiles and operations to enable patient access to their health data. Analyzing the provided content, the IG primarily focuses on defining FHIR profiles for various clinical resources, such as AllergyIntolerance, Condition, DocumentReference, Immunization, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, Observation, Patient, Practitioner, and PractitionerRole. These profiles specify the mandatory and must-support elements, extensions, and value sets that systems must support to claim conformance to the IPA IG. \n\nThe IG also defines two actors: the IPA Client and the IPA Server, outlining their respective responsibilities in the data exchange process. It heavily relies on the SMART App Launch framework for security and authorization, detailing the required SMART on FHIR capabilities for both clients and servers. The IG also specifies how to declare conformance using CapabilityStatements and defines an operation ($docref) for retrieving documents related to a patient. \n\nFurthermore, the IG provides guidance on fetching patient records, synchronizing patient data, and addressing internationalization issues. It emphasizes the importance of patient privacy and safety, referencing relevant sections in the FHIR specification. The IG also includes downloadable artifacts, such as the package file, a downloadable copy of the specification, examples, and OpenAPI definition files. \n\nBased on this analysis, the IPA IG primarily focuses on data modeling by defining FHIR profiles and data exchange by specifying the RESTful interactions and operations for accessing patient data. It also touches upon security and privacy by referencing the SMART App Launch framework and providing guidance on patient privacy and safety. The IG is intended for international use, as indicated by its name and the use of the \"Universal Realm\" jurisdiction. It primarily targets technical implementers, such as EHR vendors and system integrators, as well as healthcare provider organizations and public health organizations.",
