  "rationale": "The CARIN Digital Insurance Card (C4DIC) Implementation Guide (IG) defines a framework for payers to present digital insurance card information to consumers via a FHIR API or SMART Health Link. The core of this IG is the specification of three FHIR profiles: C4DIC Coverage, C4DIC Organization, and C4DIC Patient. These profiles are designed to represent the essential data elements found on physical insurance cards in a standardized, digital format.\n\nThe C4DIC Coverage profile extends the base FHIR Coverage resource to include details such as plan beneficiaries, additional card information (e.g., free text fields), card issue date, color palette for rendering, and various images (logo, QR code, barcode, supporting images). It also specifies how to represent member ID, subscriber, beneficiary, dependent number, plan type, payer details, group/division/network identifiers, and pharmacy benefit information (RxBIN, RxPCN, RxGRP, RxID). Importantly, it allows for the representation of copay details both as structured data (Money) and as free text strings when necessary.\n\nThe C4DIC Organization profile, based on the US Core Organization profile, is used to convey information about the payer organization, including identifiers (e.g., Payer ID), contact details (address, phone, web address, customer service), and specific contact types (e.g., pharmacists, mail order pharmacy, provider service, virtual care services).\n\nThe C4DIC Patient profile is a data-minimized version of the FHIR Patient resource, focusing on information typically found on insurance cards, such as member name, date of birth (optional), and gender (optional). It is specifically designed for conveying insurance card-related information and not intended for broader clinical use.\n\nIn addition to these profiles, the IG defines several extensions to capture specific data elements not present in the base FHIR resources. These include extensions for plan beneficiaries, additional card information, card issue date, color palette, logo, QR code, barcode, supporting images, and beneficiary cost as a string.\n\nThe IG also specifies required search parameters for Coverage, Organization, and Patient resources to enable efficient retrieval of relevant data. It outlines conformance requirements for actors (Consumer App and Health Plan API) and provides guidance on handling missing data, conformance to US Core profiles, and security/privacy considerations.\n\nFurthermore, the IG includes a section on physical insurance card data elements, mapping them to the corresponding FHIR elements in the defined profiles. It also provides a use case for consumer access to insurance card data, including a technical workflow diagram and a description of the actors involved.\n\nFinally, the IG supports the use of SMART Health Links for creating verifiable, portable digital insurance cards, in addition to the FHIR API-based exchange. It outlines the requirements for payers, consumer apps, and providers when using SMART Health Links for digital insurance card exchange.",
