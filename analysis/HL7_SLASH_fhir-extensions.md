# fhir-extensions: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG provides a registry and definitions for FHIR extensions. The context is FHIR resource development and usage. It aims to standardize and document extensions for use across different FHIR implementations. The primary audience is FHIR implementers and developers who need to use or create FHIR extensions. Specifically, it defines extensions related to patient interpreter requirements, and custom validation rules for questionnaires.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG provides a central registry for extensions, making it easier to discover and reuse existing extensions. It also provides specific guidance on how to report the results of custom validation rules via OperationOutcome, improving interoperability by standardizing error reporting. It defines specific extensions, for example, `patient-interpreterRequired`, to standardize the representation of interpreter needs.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include: a registry of FHIR extensions with base URI of `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/`; definitions of specific extensions like `patient-interpreterRequired` for indicating interpreter needs; a mechanism for defining and reporting custom validation rules on questionnaires using `targetConstraint` extensions; and guidance on how to map validation results to the `OperationOutcome` resource. The technical approach involves defining `StructureDefinition` resources for extensions and using FHIRPath for validation rules.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds upon the FHIR standard by defining extensions to accommodate specific use cases that are not explicitly covered by the core FHIR resources. By standardizing these extensions and providing a registry, it aims to promote interoperability, which is a key goal of many healthcare standards and regulations. It is part of the HL7 FHIR ecosystem.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are FHIR implementers, developers, and data analysts who need to use or create FHIR extensions. Patients are indirect beneficiaries as standardized extensions and validation rules lead to improved data quality and more consistent patient care information exchange. For example, the `patient-interpreterRequired` extension directly relates to patient care by ensuring proper communication.
