    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide focuses on the exchange of radiation dose summaries, primarily driven by regulations in California and France. While it leverages international standards like DICOM and FHIR, the explicit mention of specific regulations in these two countries suggests a strong focus on their requirements. However, the guide does not explicitly state that it is governed by either of these jurisdictions, and the content is adaptable to other regions with similar needs. Therefore, it is scored as having important jurisdiction-specific content and adaptations for both the US and France, but not exclusively designed for either.",
