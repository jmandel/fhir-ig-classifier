    "summary": "This Implementation Guide, QI-Core, is fundamentally based on FHIR and extends US Core to standardize clinical data representation for quality improvement. It does not directly involve HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it focus on CDA document exchange. While it acknowledges and maps to models like QDM (which has roots in v3), its core approach is entirely FHIR-centric. The IG does show some cross-paradigm awareness by mapping to QDM and mentioning vMR, but this is not a central aspect of its design.",
