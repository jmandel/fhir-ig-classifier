It leverages FHIR's RESTful approach and resource model extensively. While it acknowledges other HL7 standards, it does not directly integrate or depend on them. Cross-paradigm integration is minimal, focusing primarily on FHIR. There is no mention or use of v2 or v3 messaging or models, nor is there any use of CDA.",
