# davinci-vbpr: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the exchange of value-based performance reports between payers and providers. It focuses on representing financial, quality, and utilization metrics from value-based contracts in a structured, interoperable format using FHIR. The context is the growing adoption of value-based care models, where provider payments are linked to performance on specific measures. It is designed for payers, who generate these performance reports, and providers, who receive and use them to understand their performance.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves upon previous approaches by standardizing the format and content of value-based performance reports. It provides specific FHIR profiles, extensions, and value sets to represent payment streams, performance metrics, and quality measures, which were previously unstructured or inconsistent. It also provides a framework to support reporting on various value-based payment models.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    -   Use of FHIR MeasureReport as the base for the Value-Based Performance MeasureReport.
    -   Extensible value sets for performance metrics and payment streams.
    -   Specific extensions to the MeasureReport resource for baseline, service periods, paid-through dates, and alternate data types for scores.
    -   Support for stratifying performance metrics based on various factors like facility, cohort, and geography.
    -   Reusing the CQFM Composite Measure profile to represent a value-based contract.
    -   Use of DEQM Summary MeasureReport as the basis for a VBP Quality MeasureReport.
    -   Use of organization subject extension to allow using Organization as a subject.
    -   Use of "contractual status" to identify if a measure is tied to payment, reporting only, or an alternate measure.
    -   Definition of search parameters to facilitate querying of MeasureReports based on various criteria.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is built upon the HL7 FHIR R4 standard and leverages US Core profiles, aligning with broader interoperability efforts. It also aligns with the HCPLAN Alternative Payment Model (APM) framework, providing a structure for representing different types of value-based payment models. This promotes compliance with industry-wide initiatives and regulations related to quality reporting and value-based care.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are payers, who generate the value-based performance reports, and providers, who receive and use them to track and manage their performance under value-based contracts. Patients indirectly benefit from improved healthcare quality and efficiency resulting from the use of value-based care models.
