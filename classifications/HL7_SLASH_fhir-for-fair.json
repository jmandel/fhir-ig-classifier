  "rationale": "The \"fhir-for-fair\" Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on providing guidance and specifications for representing metadata related to research studies and subject-level data using HL7 FHIR, with the goal of enhancing the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of health data. \n\nThe IG defines several FHIR profiles, including `Library-uv-f4f`, `ResearchStudy-uv-f4f`, `DocumentManifest-uv-f4f`, and `List-uv-f4f`. These profiles are designed to capture study-level and subject-level metadata in a structured and standardized way using FHIR resources. The `Library-uv-f4f` profile, for instance, is used to convey metadata information for FAIR datasets, while the `ResearchStudy-uv-f4f` profile is used for FAIR collections of data at the study level. The `DocumentManifest-uv-f4f` and `List-uv-f4f` profiles are used for subject-level metadata.\n\nThe IG also includes examples of how to use these profiles to represent metadata for real-world cases, such as the FAIR4Health project and the NInFEA case. These examples demonstrate the practical application of the defined profiles and provide concrete instances of how metadata can be structured using FHIR resources.\n\nFurthermore, the IG addresses the relationship between FHIR and the FAIR principles, providing recommendations on how to implement the FAIR principles when using FHIR resources. It also discusses the mapping between the RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model indicators and the FHIR standard.\n\nBased on the content and purpose of the \"fhir-for-fair\" IG, it can be classified as primarily focusing on data modeling and knowledge representation, with a secondary focus on data exchange. The IG is based on FHIR R4 and is intended for a universal realm, although it includes examples from specific projects and initiatives. The primary stakeholders are technical implementers, researchers, and standards organizations.",
