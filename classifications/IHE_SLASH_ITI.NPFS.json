It heavily relies on data profiles to define the structure and constraints for these resources and transaction bundles. Terminology plays a significant role in categorizing and classifying files. While messaging isn't directly used, the concept of transactions implies a message-like exchange. Decision support, forms, and UI are not within the scope of this IG.
