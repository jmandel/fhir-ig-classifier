It heavily relies on FHIR resources and interactions, with minimal acknowledgment of other HL7 standards. The IG profiles core FHIR resources and defines specific search parameters to facilitate the discovery of healthcare providers and their secure messaging endpoints. It does not utilize CDA, v2, or v3 in a significant way, and its cross-paradigm support is limited to referencing v2 formatting guidance.",

It heavily relies on data profiles and RESTful interactions for searching and retrieving provider information, particularly endpoints for secure messaging.

While messaging is a core concern, the IG primarily uses RESTful APIs for data access rather than defining specific messaging interactions.
