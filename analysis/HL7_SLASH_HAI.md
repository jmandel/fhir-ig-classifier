# HAI: Analysis

1.  **Objectives and Context:**
    This Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the electronic reporting of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It seeks to improve the efficiency and accuracy of HAI data collection from healthcare facilities. By providing a common standard, it enables different software systems to seamlessly submit HAI data to NHSN, facilitating national surveillance and analysis of HAIs.

2.  **Improvements over Previous Approaches:**
    The IG introduces a FHIR Questionnaire-based approach, utilizing the FHIR Questionnaire resource to mirror the structure of actual NHSN forms. This approach is more flexible and adaptable compared to previous methods, potentially allowing for easier updates and additions to the reporting forms. Additionally, the IG explicitly aligns with the existing CDA Implementation Guide, ensuring consistency between the two standards and facilitating a smoother transition for implementers.

3.  **Key Features and Technical Approaches:**
    *   **FHIR Questionnaire-based:** The IG leverages FHIR Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses to structure and transmit HAI data.
    *   **Profiles:** It defines FHIR profiles that constrain the use of Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses for HAI reporting, ensuring data consistency and validity.
    *   **Value Sets:** It utilizes standardized value sets for specific data elements (e.g., infection types, drug susceptibility findings) to ensure consistent coding and facilitate interoperability.
    *   **Mapping to CDA:** It provides clear mappings between the FHIR-based structures and the existing CDA-based standard for HAI reporting, enabling compatibility and potential data exchange between systems using either standard.

4.  **Relationship to Healthcare Standards and Regulations:**
    *   **HL7 FHIR:** The IG is built upon the HL7 FHIR standard, a widely recognized standard for healthcare data exchange.
    *   **NHSN:** It directly supports the data collection requirements of the NHSN, a national surveillance system for HAIs.
    *   **Public Health Service Act:** It acknowledges the data protection provisions of the Public Health Service Act, which ensure the confidentiality of reported HAI data.

5.  **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**
    *   **Software Developers:** Developers of healthcare software systems that need to submit HAI data to NHSN will use this IG to ensure their systems meet the required standards.
    *   **Healthcare Facilities:** Hospitals and other healthcare facilities participating in NHSN will benefit from the standardized reporting, potentially reducing the burden of data submission and improving data quality.
    *   **Public Health Agencies:** The CDC and other public health agencies responsible for tracking and analyzing HAI data will benefit from the increased standardization and efficiency of data collection.
    *   **Patients:** Although not direct users of the IG, patients ultimately benefit from improved HAI surveillance, which can lead to better infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings.
