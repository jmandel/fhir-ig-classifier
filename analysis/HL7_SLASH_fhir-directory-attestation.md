# fhir-directory-attestation: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom? Explain its objectives in simple terms.**

    This IG aims to establish a standardized method for creating, managing, and accessing validated healthcare directory data. It seeks to address the current fragmented landscape of healthcare directories by defining a common set of FHIR profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters. The context is the healthcare industry, where numerous organizations maintain directories that are often inconsistent, out-of-date, and difficult to interoperate. The intended audience includes organizations that need to manage and exchange provider, organization, and service information.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches? (Use only information from the input files; avoid speculation.)**

    This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing a concrete set of FHIR profiles for core directory resources (Practitioner, Organization, Location, etc.), unlike previous systems that may have lacked interoperability due to inconsistent data formats or APIs. It defines specific RESTful operations and search parameters, which facilitates more consistent and predictable data exchange. It also includes mechanisms for indicating restrictions on data access and for attesting to and validating data, which improves data quality and trust. The inclusion of bulk data and subscription mechanisms enable more efficient data exchange compared to traditional methods.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?**

    Key features and technical approaches include:
    *   **FHIR Profiles:** Defines specific profiles for resources like Practitioner, Organization, Location, and others, providing a common structure for directory data.
    *   **RESTful API:** Specifies a RESTful API using FHIR, enabling standard interactions to read, search, and update data.
    *   **Search Parameters:** Defines a set of search parameters for each resource type, allowing for flexible and targeted data retrieval.
    *   **Security:** Mandates the use of SMART Backend Services Authorization and TLS 1.2 or higher.
    *   **Bulk Data Export:** Supports bulk data export using nd-json format, allowing for efficient retrieval of large datasets.
    *   **Subscriptions:** Allows for push notifications of data updates based on defined search criteria.
    *   **Data Validation and Attestation:**  Provides extensions and profiles for data validation, attestation, and restrictions on access.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?**

     This IG builds upon the FHIR standard, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in healthcare interoperability. It aligns with the goals of the ONC and FHA in the US, which promote the use of interoperable standards to improve healthcare data exchange. This IG also addresses requirements for data validation and security, which are essential for compliance with regulations such as HIPAA in the US. It also leverages existing code systems (e.g. SNOMED, LOINC, NUCC) for standardizing terminology.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?**

    The primary users and beneficiaries of this IG are:
    *   Healthcare providers and organizations who need a reliable and interoperable way to manage and exchange directory data.
    *   Payer organizations who need to maintain accurate and up-to-date provider network directories.
    *   Health information exchanges (HIEs) and health information service providers (HISPs) who need to exchange provider data.
    *   Government agencies who need to track and manage healthcare resources.
    *   Patients may indirectly benefit from improved data quality and more accurate provider directories, which can assist them in finding and selecting the right care providers and services.
