# termchangeset-ig: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to define a standardized way to represent and manage changes to terminologies (like code systems such as HL7 VariableRole, LOINC, and SNOMED CT). It provides a method for creating "change sets" that capture incremental updates, additions, or modifications to terminologies. This is done within the context of needing a more structured way to handle terminology updates that can be applied to existing systems, rather than requiring a full replacement. The IG is primarily for terminology maintainers, implementers, and those involved in managing and distributing terminology changes.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** The IG introduces the concept of a "ChangeSet" as a specific type of CodeSystem, which allows for the explicit representation of incremental changes. Previous approaches likely lacked this structured representation, making it difficult to track, manage, and apply changes to terminologies in a consistent and interoperable manner. The use of Provenance resources linked to ChangeSets provides an auditable trail of who made what changes, when, and why. The IG provides specific profiles for LOINC and SNOMED CT change sets, building upon the base change set profile and providing explicit mappings and additional properties.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **ChangeSet Profile:** A profile of the FHIR CodeSystem resource to represent a set of terminology changes.
    *   **TerminologyChangeSetProvenance Profile:** A profile of the FHIR Provenance resource to track the history and authorship of change sets.
    *   **Specialized Profiles:**  Profiles for LOINC and SNOMED CT ChangeSets that include specific properties and filters relevant to those terminologies.
    *   **Use of Extensions:** Extensions to capture specific SNOMED CT metadata such as case sensitivity, acceptability, and defining relationship types.
    *   **Fragment Content:** ChangeSets are defined as having a content type of "fragment" indicating they contain only a portion of a terminology.
    *   **Filters:** The IG specifies filters for selecting codes based on hierarchy, logical definitions, and expressions, for example, in SNOMED CT.
    *   **Property Definitions:** Explicitly defined properties for concepts within change sets, aligning with specific terminology requirements such as LOINC and SNOMED CT.
    *   **Mappings:** Explicit mappings to the Tinkar Reference Model, highlighting how these FHIR resources translate to a specific information model.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds upon the core FHIR standard and leverages existing code systems (HL7 VariableRole, LOINC, SNOMED CT), which are widely used in healthcare. The IG supports interoperability by providing a standardized method for representing and exchanging terminology changes. The copyright statements included in the resources suggest an awareness of licensing and intellectual property concerns, which are important in healthcare data exchange. The IG also includes references to HL7 work groups and specifications like the HL7 Attachment Specification.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are:
    *   **Terminology Maintainers:** Those responsible for creating and publishing terminology changes.
    *   **Implementers:** Those who need to integrate terminology changes into their systems.
    *   **Terminology Infrastructure Work Groups:** Those who manage and develop terminology standards.
    *   **Integrated Knowledge Management:** Organizations that manage and distribute knowledge assets, including terminologies.
    While patients may not directly interact with this IG, they indirectly benefit from improved data quality, consistency, and interoperability made possible by more robust terminology management.
