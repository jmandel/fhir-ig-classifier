It heavily relies on RESTful interactions for communication between the EHR and CDS service, utilizes data profiles for structuring information, and employs terminology standards for precise clinical concepts. Decision support is a core component, leveraging CQL for expressing PDDI logic. While messaging and subscriptions are not directly used, the event-driven nature of CDS Hooks implies a form of event notification. Forms/UI and documents are not central to this IG.",
