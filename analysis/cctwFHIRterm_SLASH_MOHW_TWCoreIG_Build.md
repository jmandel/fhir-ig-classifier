# MOHW_TWCoreIG_Build: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG, titled "TW Core IG," aims to define how FHIR data types should be further specified to represent Taiwanese healthcare data, particularly for CodeableConcept and Coding. It focuses on creating profiles that extend FHIR's base resources to accommodate the specific needs of Taiwan's healthcare system. The context is the need to standardize the representation of healthcare data in Taiwan using FHIR. The intended audience is primarily implementers and developers working with healthcare data in Taiwan.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG improves upon previous approaches by providing specific profiles for common FHIR data types like CodeableConcept and Coding, incorporating Taiwan-specific requirements. It also introduces extensions for representing Taiwanese address components and identifiers, which are not part of the base FHIR specification. This allows for more accurate and contextually relevant data representation.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **Profiles:** It defines specific profiles for various FHIR resources, such as AllergyIntolerance, Bundle, Composition, Condition, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Encounter, ImagingStudy, Immunization, Location, Media, Medication, MedicationDispense, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, MessageHeader, Observation, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Procedure, Provenance, QuestionnaireResponse, RelatedPerson, ServiceRequest, and Specimen.
    *   **Extensions:** It uses extensions to add Taiwan-specific address components (e.g., alley, lane, village, neighborhood, section, number, floor, room, postal code), identifier suffixes, and person age to the base FHIR resources.
    *   **Code Systems & Value Sets:** It references specific code systems and value sets for use within its profiles (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT, and Taiwan-specific codes for medical services, medications, and postal codes)
    *   **Examples:** Provides numerous examples demonstrating the use of profiles and extensions for data representation.
    *   **Mappings:** Includes mappings between the logical models and the profiles to clarify the structure of the data.
    *   **Structure Definitions:** Profiles are based on StructureDefinitions.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds on the FHIR standard, aiming to provide a localized implementation for Taiwan. It utilizes international standards like LOINC and SNOMED CT for terminologies and aligns with HL7's FHIR specifications. It incorporates Taiwan's local code systems for identifiers, medications, and postal codes.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are implementers and developers of healthcare IT systems in Taiwan who need to exchange and store data using FHIR. The ultimate beneficiaries are patients, as this IG aims to facilitate better information exchange and interoperability in their healthcare records, leading to improved care and outcomes. While patients may not directly use the IG, it is designed to ensure that their information is managed accurately and efficiently.
