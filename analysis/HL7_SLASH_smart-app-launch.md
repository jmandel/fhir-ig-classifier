# smart-app-launch: Analysis

## 1. Objectives and Context

The SMART App Launch Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the way third-party applications connect to and interact with electronic health record (EHR) systems and other FHIR-based data systems. It defines a framework for secure authorization, authentication, and integration, enabling apps to access and utilize health data in a standardized and secure manner.

The IG targets developers building healthcare applications (apps) that need to access and utilize patient or user-level health data. It aims to:

- **Streamline app development**:  Provide a consistent approach for connecting apps to EHRs, simplifying development and integration efforts.
- **Enhance data security**:  Establish robust security mechanisms, ensuring authorized access and protecting patient privacy.
- **Improve user experience**:  Enable a seamless and intuitive experience for users accessing health information through apps.

## 2. Improvements over Previous Approaches

SMART App Launch 2.0 introduces several key improvements over its predecessor (version 1.0), including:

- **Finer-grained access control**:  Provides more granular scope definitions, allowing apps to request access to specific data elements based on FHIR search parameters.
- **Enhanced security**:  Mandates support for Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to mitigate the risk of authorization code interception.
- **Improved context management**: Introduces the `fhirContext` parameter for conveying broader launch context beyond just patient and encounter.
- **Support for backend services**:  Defines a separate authorization flow for backend services, enabling secure access for automated systems.
- **Streamlined branding**:  Provides a standardized approach for publishing and displaying brand information to enhance user experience.

## 3. Key Features and Technical Approaches

SMART App Launch leverages the following key features and technical approaches:

- **OAuth 2.0**:  Utilizes the OAuth 2.0 framework for authorization and authentication, ensuring secure delegation of user permissions to apps.
- **OpenID Connect**:  Integrates with OpenID Connect for user authentication and single sign-on capabilities.
- **FHIR**:  Relies on the HL7 FHIR standard for data exchange, ensuring interoperability and consistent data access.
- **Scopes**:  Defines a robust scope language, allowing apps to request access to specific data categories and actions.
- **Launch Context**:  Provides mechanisms for conveying contextual information, such as the current patient or encounter, to apps during launch.
- **Token Introspection**:  Supports token introspection, enabling resource servers to validate and understand access tokens issued by the authorization server.
- **Branding**:  Defines a standardized approach for publishing and displaying brand information to enhance user experience.
- **App State**:  Provides a mechanism for apps to persist state information securely on the EHR.

## 4. Relationship to Healthcare Standards and Regulations

SMART App Launch aligns with broader healthcare standards and regulations, including:

- **HIPAA**:  Supports HIPAA compliance by enabling secure authorization and data access, protecting patient privacy.
- **FHIR**:  Adheres to the HL7 FHIR standard, promoting interoperability and consistent data exchange.
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect**:  Leverages widely adopted security standards, ensuring secure authentication and authorization.

## 5. Primary Users and Beneficiaries

The primary users and beneficiaries of SMART App Launch include:

- **App Developers**:  Benefit from a standardized framework for connecting apps to EHRs, simplifying development and integration.
- **Healthcare Providers**:  Gain access to a wider ecosystem of innovative apps that can enhance patient care and improve workflows.
- **Patients**:  Benefit from a more seamless and intuitive experience when accessing their health information through apps, empowering them to actively participate in their care.
- **Healthcare Organizations**:  Can leverage SMART App Launch to enhance interoperability, improve data security, and foster innovation within their systems.
