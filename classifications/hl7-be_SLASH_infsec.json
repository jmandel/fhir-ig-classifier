  "rationale": "The `infsec` Implementation Guide primarily focuses on defining mechanisms for pseudonymization and ensuring data integrity within the Belgian eHealth Platform. It introduces extensions like `BeExtPseudonymization`, `BeExtKeyPseudonymization`, and `BeExtIntendedProfile` to facilitate these functionalities. \n\n`BeExtPseudonymization` marks fields as pseudonymized and specifies the technique used (direct or encrypted). `BeExtKeyPseudonymization` handles encryption keys for longer texts, while `BeExtIntendedProfile` ensures semantic integrity by specifying the intended profile and version. The IG also defines a `CapabilityStatement` outlining support for different pseudonymization versions and includes example instances demonstrating the use of these extensions in `Patient` and `Parameters` resources. The `guidance.md` file provides detailed explanations of the pseudonymization techniques and their implementation, including content negotiation using HTTP headers. The IG emphasizes the importance of computable and semantic integrity, particularly for data stored in vaults. It references discussions on FHIR's chat platform regarding digital signatures, integrity, and profile version management. The IG is built using FHIR R4 and is specific to Belgium, as indicated by the canonical URL, jurisdiction, and use of Belgian-specific code systems and naming systems.",
