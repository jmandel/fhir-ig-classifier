  "rationale": "The ITI.MHDS Implementation Guide defines a Document Registry actor that orchestrates the interaction of several other IHE profiles to enable a FHIR-based document sharing infrastructure. The core functionality revolves around the publication, management, and retrieval of healthcare documents. \n\n- **Publication:** The Document Registry, acting as an MHD Document Recipient, receives and validates document metadata and content submitted by Document Sources via the ITI-65 transaction. It enforces metadata consistency, validates patient identity, and persists the submitted resources (DocumentReference, List, Binary).\n\n- **Management:** The Document Registry manages the lifecycle of documents, including deprecating DocumentReferences when replaced. It also handles patient identity merges received from a PMIR Patient Identity Consumer, updating references accordingly.\n\n- **Retrieval:** The Document Registry, acting as an MHD Document Responder, supports document discovery and retrieval by Document Consumers via ITI-66, ITI-67, and ITI-68 transactions. It enforces authorization and ensures only permitted results are returned.\n\n- **Options:** MHDS defines several options, including Authorization (using IUA), Consent Management (also using IUA for enforcing patient privacy consents), SVCM Validation (using SVCM for metadata validation), and UnContained Reference (allowing references to external resources like mCSD and PMIR).\n\n- **Security:** MHDS emphasizes security through ATNA, requiring secure communication, audit logging, and authorization. The Authorization and Consent Management options further enhance security and privacy.\n\n- **Dependencies:** MHDS heavily relies on other IHE profiles, including MHD, PMIR, SVCM, mCSD, IUA, ATNA, CT, and BALP. It assembles these profiles to create a comprehensive document sharing solution.\n\n- **Artifacts:** The IG defines a CapabilityStatement for the Document Registry, outlining its requirements and supported interactions. It also includes a test plan and addresses open and closed issues related to the profile's development.",
