EHR systems are central to this IG, as they are responsible for collecting, structuring, and transmitting the necessary data. Public health systems, specifically the NHSN, are also key recipients of this data. Pharmacy systems play an important role in providing medication administration data, and lab systems provide blood glucose results. Clinical decision support systems could potentially leverage this data for real-time alerts, but the IG primarily focuses on retrospective reporting. Research platforms might utilize the aggregated data for broader studies. Other system types have minimal or no involvement.",

The design is driven by the need for standardized data exchange between EHRs and NHSN, with a strong emphasis on data quality and consistency for accurate reporting and analysis. Clinical care teams indirectly benefit from improved patient safety insights, while public health agencies and government bodies leverage the collected data for surveillance and quality improvement initiatives.
