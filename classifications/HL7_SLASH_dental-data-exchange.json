While it acknowledges v2 and v3 through its use of terminologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC, these standards are not central to its core functionality. The IG demonstrates a cross-paradigm approach by integrating FHIR with C-CDA and other relevant standards.",

    "summary": "This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on enabling interoperability between dental and medical providers for improved care coordination. Clinical Care Teams, particularly dental providers, are the core users, driving the design with their need for standardized data exchange. Medical providers also have a significant role, as the IG facilitates communication between medical and dental domains. Payers are also a key user group, as the IG mentions their involvement in the ecosystem and the relevance to value-based care. Public Health Agencies and Research Organizations have a minimal role, as the IG doesn't explicitly address their needs. Government Agencies have a limited role, primarily related to the IG's focus on the US Realm and potential regulatory implications. Patients and Caregivers are not directly involved in the IG's design, but they are indirect beneficiaries of improved care coordination.",
