It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 messaging, nor does it directly leverage CDA. While it doesn't explicitly integrate multiple HL7 paradigms, its reliance on FHIR and its relationship to other IHE profiles that might use different HL7 standards suggests a minimal level of cross-paradigm awareness.",

It primarily addresses the need for efficient and secure access to patient information in mobile and web-based applications.

While it touches upon security and workflow, these are primarily in service of the main goal of patient demographic query. Clinical data is limited to demographic information, and other domains like care planning, medications, and diagnostics are not addressed.",
