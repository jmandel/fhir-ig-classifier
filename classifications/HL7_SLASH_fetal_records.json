  "rationale": "The `fetal_records` Implementation Guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining how to represent and exchange data related to a fetus within the HL7 FHIR standard. It establishes a new profile, `IBCMFetalPatient`, which extends the base FHIR `Patient` resource to specifically model a fetus. This profile includes a mandatory extension, `patient-fetalStatus`, to indicate the status of the fetus. The IG also provides guidance on when to use a separate resource for the fetus and how to identify the fetus, particularly in cases of multiple fetuses. \n\nThe IG outlines three basic use cases: medication requests, result reporting, and data transfer. These use cases demonstrate how to use the `IBCMFetalPatient` profile and other FHIR resources to represent clinical scenarios involving a fetus. For example, the medication request use case shows how to specify that a medication is intended for the fetus, not the mother. The result reporting use case demonstrates how to report diagnostic results related to the fetus, such as ultrasound findings. The data transfer use case illustrates how to exchange a set of data that includes information about the mother, fetus, and pregnancy.\n\nThe IG includes several example instances of FHIR resources, such as `Patient`, `Observation`, `Condition`, `DiagnosticReport`, `Procedure`, `MedicationRequest`, and `RelatedPerson`. These examples demonstrate how to populate the resources with data relevant to the fetus and link them together to represent the clinical context. The examples cover various aspects of fetal care, including gestational age assessment, fetal growth monitoring, diagnosis of fetal conditions, and medication administration.\n\nWhile the IG references other FHIR resources and terminologies, its core contribution is the definition of the `IBCMFetalPatient` profile and the guidance on its use in representing and exchanging fetal data. The IG is intended for IT developers who build systems for the child health and obstetrics sector, as well as stakeholders who provide requirements for these systems. The IG's scope is limited to the informational aspect of data handling in the regular process flow of pregnancy and birth healthcare, and it explicitly excludes legal, religious, or political issues.",
