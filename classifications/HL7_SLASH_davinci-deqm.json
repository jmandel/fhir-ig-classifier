  "rationale": "The DaVinci Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) Implementation Guide (IG) is focused on enabling the exchange of quality measure data and reporting in a standardized way using FHIR. Analyzing its core functionality:\n\n1.  **Data Exchange:** The IG defines operations like `$submit-data` and `$collect-data` to facilitate the exchange of data of interest between data producers (e.g., providers) and consumers (e.g., payers). These operations are central to the IG's purpose.\n2.  **Measure Reporting:** The IG defines profiles for Individual, Summary, and Subject List MeasureReports. These profiles specify how to structure MeasureReport resources for different reporting scenarios, including defining required elements and extensions.\n3.  **Gaps in Care Reporting:** The IG introduces the `$care-gaps` operation and associated profiles (e.g., `DEQM Gaps In Care Bundle Profile`, `DEQM Gaps In Care Composition Profile`) to identify and report gaps in care based on quality measures. This functionality allows for proactive identification of care needs.\n4.  **Profiles and Extensions:** The IG defines several profiles and extensions to tailor FHIR resources for quality measure data exchange and reporting. These include profiles for `MeasureReport`, `Bundle`, `Composition`, `DetectedIssue`, and extensions like `measureScoring`, `reportingVendor`, and `gapStatus`.\n5.  **Operations:** The IG defines several operations in addition to those mentioned above, including `$evaluate` and `$bulk-submit-data`. These operations support various aspects of quality measure evaluation and data exchange.\n6.  **Terminology:** The IG references specific code systems and value sets relevant to quality measurement, ensuring consistent use of terminology across implementations.\n7.  **Examples:** The IG provides numerous examples demonstrating how to use the defined operations, profiles, and extensions in various scenarios, such as medication reconciliation and colorectal cancer screening.\n\nBased on this analysis, the DEQM IG primarily focuses on defining data models (profiles and extensions), data exchange mechanisms (operations), and reporting structures (MeasureReport types) to support quality measurement and improvement using FHIR.",
