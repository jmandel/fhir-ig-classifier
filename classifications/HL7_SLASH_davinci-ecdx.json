    "summary": "The Da Vinci Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR R4 for defining RESTful interactions and data structures. It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 directly, nor does it focus on CDA. While it acknowledges the existence of X12 transactions and aims to complement them, this does not constitute a significant integration with a specific HL7 standard. The IG does demonstrate a degree of cross-paradigm thinking by bridging FHIR with existing X12 workflows, but this is not a core aspect of its design.",
