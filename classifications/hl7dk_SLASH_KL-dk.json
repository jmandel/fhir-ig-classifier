  "rationale": "The KL-dk FHIR implementation guide primarily focuses on defining a core information model for exchanging and reporting health care and social care data from Danish municipalities. It establishes profiles based on the FHIR R4 standard, aligning with the documentation practices of FSIII and FFB, which are used for routine documentation in home care nursing, health promotion, physical rehabilitation, and adult social care in Denmark. \n\nThe guide specifies how to structure various healthcare concepts using FHIR resources, including service requests, care plans, planned and completed interventions, encounters, information gathering, observations, conditions, evaluations, and goals. It provides detailed mappings between the attributes defined in the Danish \"FÃ¦lleskommunal Informationsmodel\" (FKI) and the corresponding FHIR profile attributes. The guide also includes examples illustrating how these profiles can be used to represent different scenarios, such as home care service requests, nursing status, adult social care information gathering, and intervention planning.\n\nWhile the guide references external resources and dependencies, its core function is to define a set of FHIR profiles tailored to the specific needs of Danish municipalities. It emphasizes data modeling, specifying the structure and content of data elements, rather than data exchange mechanisms. The guide is intended for use within the national jurisdiction of Denmark and targets technical implementers, healthcare provider organizations, and public health organizations involved in the Danish healthcare system.",
