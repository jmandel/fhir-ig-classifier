# fhir-military-service: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize the way military service history and status are recorded and shared using FHIR APIs. It provides a framework for exchanging this information between different systems, particularly in the context of healthcare and veteran services in the US. The goal is to enable better care and access to benefits for veterans by making their military service history readily available to clinicians, community service agencies, and employers.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG introduces a standardized, FHIR-based approach to representing military service history, moving away from ad-hoc or local methods. It leverages existing standards like US Core, LOINC, SNOMED CT, and CDC ODH, which promotes interoperability and reusability. It also defines a custom operation (\$veteranStatus) for verifying veteran status, which enables consistent, standards-based verification processes. The IG introduces specific profiles for Military Service Episodes, Deployment History, and Military Occupations, which allows for a more granular and structured representation of veteran's service history.

3.  **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include:
    *   **FHIR Profiles:** Defines profiles for `USVeteran`, `MilitaryServiceEpisode`, `DeploymentHistoryEpisode`, and `MilitaryOccupation`, building upon or directly profiling FHIR `Observation` and `Patient` resources.
    *   **US Core Alignment:** Extends the US Core Patient profile and adheres to US Core conformance requirements.
    *   **Terminology Bindings:** Specifies terminology bindings to LOINC, SNOMED CT, and CDC ODH code systems for consistent data representation.
    *   **Slicing:** Uses slicing to define specific components within the `Observation` resource for military service details.
    *   **Custom Operation:** Defines a `\$veteranStatus` operation for verifying veteran status.
    *   **Must Support (MS) Obligations:** Clearly specifies which data elements must be supported by senders and receivers of data.
    *   **Extensible Terminology:** Allows for the inclusion of foreign military service information.

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG is designed to align with the US Core Implementation Guide, thus supporting US regulatory requirements related to interoperability. It aims to harmonize with the Occupational Data for Health (ODH) initiative to enhance social history reporting. It also supports compliance with Title 38 Veteran Benefits, as it provides a structured way to record and verify veteran status and military service history.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users and beneficiaries include:
    *   **Clinicians:** To access and use veteran's military service history to inform care decisions and assess health risks.
    *   **Veterans:** To access and share their military service history and status with healthcare providers, community service agencies, and other relevant entities.
    *   **Healthcare Systems:** To implement interoperable APIs for exchanging veteran-related information.
    *   **Community Service Agencies and Employers:** To verify veteran status for benefits, services, and employment opportunities.
    *  **EHR system developers:** To implement the functionality for capturing, storing, and exchanging a veterans military history.
