  "rationale": "The ITI.PIXm Implementation Guide defines a method for cross-referencing patient identifiers in a mobile environment. It specifies two FHIR-based transactions: ITI-83 (Mobile Patient Identifier Cross-reference Query) and ITI-104 (Patient Identity Feed FHIR). \n\nITI-83 defines a FHIR operation, $ihe-pix, for querying a Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. This operation allows a consumer to provide a patient identifier from one domain and receive corresponding identifiers from other domains. The request and response are defined using FHIR Parameters resources. The IG specifies the structure of these parameters, including required elements like sourceIdentifier and optional elements like targetSystem. \n\nITI-104 defines a transaction for feeding patient identity information to the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. It uses FHIR's conditional update and delete operations on the Patient resource. The IG defines a profile, PIXm Patient, that specifies the minimum set of elements that the Manager must support. It also defines how to handle adding, revising, resolving duplicates, and removing patient records. \n\nThe IG also includes security considerations, requiring the use of ATNA for audit logging and optionally IUA for authorization. It defines specific AuditEvent profiles for both ITI-83 and ITI-104, detailing the information that should be captured in audit logs. \n\nIn essence, this IG focuses on defining the mechanisms for exchanging and managing patient identifiers in a mobile environment using FHIR. It specifies the data models for requests and responses, the operations to be used, and the security requirements for these interactions. It does not define the internal logic of the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager but focuses on the interface it exposes.",
