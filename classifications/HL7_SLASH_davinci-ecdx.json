    "summary": "The Da Vinci Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) Implementation Guide is fundamentally based on FHIR R4 for defining RESTful interactions and data structures. It does not utilize HL7 v2 or v3 directly, nor does it focus on CDA. While it acknowledges and interacts with X12 standards for claims and prior authorization, this interaction is not a core part of the IG's functionality. The IG does not explicitly aim for cross-paradigm integration, but its relationship with other Da Vinci IGs and its use of US Core suggests some level of indirect integration.",

It heavily utilizes data profiles to constrain FHIR resources for its specific use cases and defines a custom operation for attachment submission. The IG also leverages the Task resource for asynchronous workflows and incorporates terminology and value sets to standardize data exchange. While REST APIs are used for direct queries, the Task-based approach and the custom operation are more central to the IG's functionality. Subscriptions are mentioned as an optional feature, and decision support, forms & UI, and messaging are not prominent aspects of this IG.",
