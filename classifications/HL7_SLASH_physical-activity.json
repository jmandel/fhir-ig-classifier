  "rationale": "This implementation guide (IG) primarily focuses on defining FHIR profiles and extensions to represent patient physical activity data. The core functionality revolves around creating standardized data models for observations, goals, care plans, service requests, and tasks related to physical activity. \n\nThe IG defines several new profiles, including `PAObservationEVSDaysPerWeek`, `PAObservationEVSMinutesPerDay`, `PAObservationEVSMinutesPerWeek`, `PAObservationStrengthDaysPerWeek`, `PAObservationActivityMeasure`, `PAObservationActivityGroup`, `PAObservationTimeMeasure`, `PACarePlan`, `PAGoal`, `PAServiceRequest`, and `PATaskForReferralManagement`. These profiles extend or constrain existing FHIR resources to capture specific data elements relevant to physical activity, such as exercise frequency, duration, intensity, and type. \n\nAdditionally, the IG defines capability statements for different actors, such as care managers, patient engagement systems, and service providers, outlining the expected interactions and supported profiles for each. It also establishes value sets and code systems for representing physical activity-related concepts. \n\nWhile the IG references other standards like US Core and SDOH Clinical Care, its primary purpose is to establish a data model for physical activity within the FHIR framework, enabling interoperable exchange of this information between different systems and stakeholders. The IG also touches upon workflow aspects by defining task resources and subscription mechanisms for managing referrals and tracking patient progress. However, the main emphasis remains on data modeling and standardization.",
