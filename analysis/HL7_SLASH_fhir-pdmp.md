# fhir-pdmp: Analysis

1.  **What is this IG trying to achieve, in what context, and for whom?** This IG aims to standardize how healthcare providers request and receive patient prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data. It focuses on enabling electronic exchange of this information, particularly when providers need the information to make decisions about opioid prescriptions and for other medication management needs. The context is the US healthcare system with its state-based PDMPs, and it is for use by healthcare providers and the systems they use (EHRs, pharmacy systems) to access PDMP data.

2.  **How does this IG improve upon previous approaches?** This IG utilizes the HL7 FHIR standard to standardize PDMP information exchange. It establishes profiles for FHIR resources (Patient, MedicationDispense, Organization, etc.) specifically tailored for PDMP use. This structured approach, compared to previous proprietary or less standardized methods (e.g., NCPDP SCRIPT, ASAP Web Services, proprietary integration options), aims to improve interoperability and reduce the complexity of accessing PDMP data. It also provides a standardized approach to support messaging and RESTful interaction patterns.

3. **What are the key features and technical approaches of this IG?** Key features include defining FHIR profiles for PDMP-specific resources (e.g., `pdmp-patient`, `pdmp-medicationdispense`, `pdmp-organization-pharmacy`) and leveraging US Core profiles. The IG defines a `pdmp-history` operation, using Parameters resources for both request and response, and a Bundle resource for the response data. It provides guidance for using CDS Hooks and SMART App Launch to integrate PDMP access into provider workflows, and defines extension elements for specific PDMP data elements (e.g., MME, LME, fill number). It also defines temporary codesystems for response status and provides mappings to other standards (PMIX and NCPDP SCRIPT).

4.  **How does this IG relate to broader healthcare standards and regulations?** This IG builds upon the HL7 FHIR standard, US Core profiles, and leverages existing terminology (e.g. RxNorm, NDC, PMIX). It acknowledges that PDMP requirements and implementation are state-based (i.e., US jurisdiction). It provides a way to achieve compliance with state mandates for PDMP checks by standardizing the data exchange process. It also acknowledges the use of SMART Backend Services Authorization Guide for security.

5.  **Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of this IG, including patients if applicable?** The primary users are healthcare providers (prescribers, pharmacists, etc.) and the software systems they use (EHRs, pharmacy systems). The ultimate beneficiaries are patients, as improved access to PDMP data can lead to safer medication practices and reduced risk of opioid misuse. Patients are also represented in the data model and the profiles, but they are not the direct users of the IG.
