Therefore, EHR systems and any system interacting with FHIR resources are central to its implementation. Systems involved in authorization and security, like those handling OAuth or SAML, also play a key role. While not directly focused on clinical decision support or specific clinical workflows, the audit trails generated are crucial for security and privacy, indirectly impacting these areas. Payer systems have minimal involvement, primarily related to potential auditing of claims data access. Public health and research platforms may need to implement these audit patterns if they handle patient data via FHIR.",
