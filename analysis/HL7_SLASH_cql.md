# cql: Analysis

1.  **Objectives, Context, and Audience:** This FHIR Implementation Guide aims to standardize the representation and exchange of clinical knowledge, specifically for use in Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Measurement (CQM). It seeks to achieve this by defining a language called Clinical Quality Language (CQL) and an underlying logical model called Expression Logical Model (ELM). The context is the growing adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and the need for a scalable, interoperable way to share clinical quality logic between different systems and organizations. The primary audience includes health IT vendors, quality agencies, quality artifact authors, and implementers of systems that create and use knowledge artifacts.

2.  **Improvement Over Previous Approaches:** The IG addresses the limitations of existing standards for expressing clinical quality logic, such as lack of tooling, complexity of implementation, and insufficient expressivity. Instead of attempting to address these shortcomings in existing standards, this specification provides a solution to enable shared understanding of clinical knowledge by defining a syntax-independent, canonical representation of logic (ELM) that can be used to express the knowledge in any given artifact, and point-to-point sharing by defining a serialization for that representation. This approach dramatically reduces the complexity of processing quality artifacts by eliminating the need for lexical analysis and parsing steps, and allowing implementations to concentrate on the core representation of the logic by making use of existing serialization formats (XML and JSON) to allow direct communication of the semantically verified logic.

3.  **Key Features and Technical Approaches:**
    *   **Clinical Quality Language (CQL):** A high-level, domain-specific language designed for clinical quality that can be used by both clinical domain experts as well as developers. It is designed to be human-readable and authorable.
    *   **Expression Logical Model (ELM):** A syntax-independent, canonical representation of logic based on Abstract Syntax Trees. It serves as an intermediate representation that can be verified, computed, and used as input for various language processing applications.
    *   **Data Model Independence:** CQL and ELM are designed to be independent of any specific data model. They can be used with any data model, provided a suitable description is supplied.
    *   **Library-Based Organization:** CQL logic is organized into libraries, which serve as containers for definitions, versioning, and distribution of logic.
    *   **Support for Terminology:** CQL has built-in support for terminologies, including codesystems, valuesets, codes, and concepts.
    *   **Comprehensive Set of Operators:** CQL includes a wide range of operators for comparison, logical operations, arithmetic, date and time manipulation, string manipulation, list operations, and aggregate functions.
    *   **Query Construct:** CQL provides a powerful query construct for filtering, shaping, and extending data from various sources.

4.  **Relationship to Broader Standards and Regulations:**
    *   **Meaningful Use:** The IG mentions that the specifications are designed to support national health initiatives, including Meaningful Use.
    *   **Nationwide Health Information Network:** The specifications are intended to support the Nationwide Health Information Network.
    *   **HL7 Standards:** The IG is sponsored by the ONC S&I Framework and developed under the HL7 Clinical Quality Framework Initiative. It relates to other HL7 standards such as HQMF, CDS Knowledge Artifact Specification, FHIR, and FHIRPath.
    *   **QDM and QI-Core:** CQL is informed by the Quality Data Model (QDM) and has been adopted by CMS for eCQMs. The IG mentions QI-Core as a harmonized data model specification for quality improvement applications.

5.  **Primary Users and Beneficiaries:**
    *   **Health IT Vendors:** Vendors can use CQL to develop tools and systems for creating, managing, and executing clinical quality logic.
    *   **Quality Agencies:** Agencies can use CQL to define and distribute standardized quality measures and decision support rules.
    *   **Clinical Artifact Authors:** Clinicians and other domain experts can use CQL to author and understand clinical quality artifacts.
    *   **Integrators:** Health IT professionals can use CQL to integrate quality artifacts into various healthcare systems.
    *   **Implementers:** System analysts, architects, and developers can use CQL and ELM to build language processing applications.
    *   **Patients:** Ultimately, patients benefit from improved quality of care and better health outcomes resulting from the effective use of clinical quality measures and decision support based on CQL.
