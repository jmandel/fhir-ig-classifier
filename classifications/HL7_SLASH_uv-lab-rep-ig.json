    "summary": "This Implementation Guide focuses on the exchange of laboratory reports using FHIR resources and RESTful interactions. It heavily relies on FHIR for its core structure and functionality, with minimal acknowledgment of other HL7 standards like v2, v3, or CDA. While it mentions a migration path from v2 and CDA, it doesn't actively support or integrate their features. Cross-paradigm integration is limited to acknowledging the existence of other standards and aiming for future harmonization.",

The IG also supports workflows related to report creation, storage, and retrieval, and touches upon public health and research use cases, but these are secondary to the core focus on clinical lab data exchange.",
