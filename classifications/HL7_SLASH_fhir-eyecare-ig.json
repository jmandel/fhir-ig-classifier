  "rationale": "The FHIR Implementation Guide \"fhir-eyecare-ig\" primarily focuses on defining FHIR profiles and value sets to represent ophthalmic clinical data, aiming to standardize data exchange within the ophthalmology domain. The IG defines several profiles for Observations, Conditions, Procedures, and Diagnostic Reports, tailored to ophthalmology-specific use cases like cataract surgery and glaucoma care. It also defines value sets for ophthalmic anatomical locations, observations, conditions, and procedures, drawing from existing terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10, and CPT. The IG emphasizes the use of FHIR R4 and targets technical implementers like EHR vendors and device manufacturers, as well as healthcare provider organizations, particularly clinical care teams in ophthalmology. While the IG mentions connectathon participation and collaboration with organizations like the NEI, indicating a US focus, it aims for broader international applicability by incorporating globally recognized terminologies. The IG's content suggests a strong emphasis on data modeling, with a secondary focus on enabling data exchange and supporting clinical workflows. It also touches upon knowledge representation through the definition of value sets and code systems, and indirectly addresses security and privacy through conformance rules.",
