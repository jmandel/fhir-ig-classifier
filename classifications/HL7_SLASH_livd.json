  "rationale": "The 'livd' IG focuses on standardizing data exchange for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test results between devices and laboratory systems, primarily using FHIR resources. This falls under the 'Infrastructure & Foundational' domain as it provides a foundational mechanism for laboratory data interoperability.  It leverages FHIR R4 and aims to improve laboratory workflows and data quality, without a specific geographic focus.",
